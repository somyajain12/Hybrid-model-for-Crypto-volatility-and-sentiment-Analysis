Personally, I reduce my DCA during the beginning of the bear phase, not because I avoid buying low, but because I prefer to concentrate those buys when prices are depressed and momentum is starting to turn. I typically scale in more aggressively 12‚Äì18 months before the next halving, when sentiment is low, valuations are attractive, and upside potential begins to build. That rhythm has served me well.

It is just a pyramid scheme that wastes energy through inefficient computation.

That is what critics say. For Bitcoinists and Bitcoiners, there is an understanding of the fundamentals as to why Bitcoin creates value and distributes it through a decentralized network of peers. It also requires energy intensive computation to secure the value of the network, and is part of the utility in processing transactions and issuing currency in BTC.

We should also focus on the innovation that Bitcoin brings to finance that can be used as a model for digital currencies. This can be an argument to counter critics claims that Bitcoin is useless, yet they don't understand the technology that goes beyond the digital ledger and to an ecosystem of non-intermediated payments.

The Reign of NGU: Is Bitcoin's Winning Narrative Also Its Philosophical Cage?,0,1kf8adc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kf8adc/the_reign_of_ngu_is_bitcoins_winning_narrative/,3,2025-05-05 05:29:58,"Let's talk about NGU. ""Number Go Up."" It's arguably the most powerful, most pervasive, and undeniably the winning narrative for Bitcoin adoption today. You see it everywhere ‚Äì in memes, in price predictions, in the core motivation for millions entering the space. It's simple, it's visceral, and it speaks a universal language: profit.
And in many ways, it works. 

The promise of NGU attracts capital, fuels network effects, and acts as a powerful validation signal in a world saturated with abstract digital concepts. It turns a complex technological and monetary innovation into an easily trackable metric of personal prosperity. It's the siren song that draws newcomers into the rabbit hole.

But here's where the philosophical knot tightens: Is NGU winning the battle for adoption at the cost of obscuring the deeper war?

By elevating ""Number Go Up"" to the primary, even sole, motivation, are we not inadvertently reducing Bitcoin from a potential instrument of monetary sovereignty and censorship resistance into just another, albeit superior, speculative asset class?

The danger is subtle. When the only reason to be here is the expectation of future price appreciation, the focus shifts entirely to market cycles, technical analysis, and chasing gains. The core principles ‚Äì the immutable ledger, the decentralized consensus, the resistance to seizure, the fixed supply as a check against inflationary fiat ‚Äì risk becoming secondary footnotes, intellectual curiosities discussed only after checking the portfolio balance.

We risk breeding a generation of ""Bitcoiners"" who understand charts but not cryptography, who grasp market cap but not monetary history, who champion decentralization only until it inconveniences their trading strategy. The revolutionary potential is commodified, packaged neatly into ticker symbols and exchange interfaces, its rough, philosophical edges smoothed down for mass consumption, driven by the simplest human impulse: accumulation.

Is NGU a necessary, perhaps even crucial, gateway drug to understanding Bitcoin's true significance? Or is it a comfortable cage, keeping the focus solely on personal wealth transfer while distracting from the potential for systemic change?

It's a paradox. The very thing driving mass adoption might be the thing that prevents mass understanding and appreciation of what Bitcoin could represent beyond just a vehicle for getting rich.

Thoughts? Are we building a new financial foundation, or just a faster, more efficient escalator to the top for those who get on board early?"

Now I am incredibly grateful but I know me going abroad will put a strain on family finances and I don't/won't feel comfortable asking money for leasure activity let alone investing in crypto xD

So my plan is to somewhat track expenses and budget and pick a part time job which will get me some money 

Now is it kinda stupid for me to dca like 100-150 pounds from My part time job? I js think the money would be better spent to become a bit more financially liberated but I would be reliant on my parents till I actually work a full time job

So sorry for the rant XD do you think I should take a part time job mainly for the sole reason to dca? (I'll most probably safe up or spend the rest of my wage on leasure)

Set up a daily buy, whatever amount you feel comfortable with. Weekly take it out into cold storage. Refuse to sell. As you make more money, increase your daily buy. Bonus at work, extra income from side hustles, birthday money? Enjoy some but use it as a bonus stack. 

Do this for years, resilience and patience. Continue to do your research, maintain your conviction, and stack sats. Best of luck to everyone, if you‚Äôre new the only advice you need, is stack slowly and have patience. There is no BTC top because there is no Fiat bottom. "

Isn't it estimated that somewhere around 3 to 4 million are already permanently lost?

If most non-institutional bitcoin end up lost, the rest of the bitcoin are being held by ETFs, banks and governments. Then bitcoin's core ethos of decentralization is undermined. Liquidity becomes centralized. Custodial bitcoin remains.

There is no incentive for institutions to discuss this issue. I suspect this strategic silence leads to the slow centralization of bitcoin and while most of us are just going 'price go up'.

There seem to be very few wallets with inheritance tools. Personally, I propose a 'dead man switch' protocol be implemented for wallets that have no inheritance management to recover bitcoin, although I wouldn't know how that would work. Even then it would have to be adopted by us retailers.

Personally, associating holdings as a percentage of total supply does a disservice to the average investor. Visually speaking, 2.64% does not seem like much. A better way to think of MicroStrategy's holdings is by relating the stack to the block reward and the total number of BTC left to be mined.

Let's say MicroStrategy does not accumulate anymore BTC. As of May 2025, there is currently a little over 1 million BTC left to be mined. Eventually there will come a day when there is only 553,555 BTC left to be mined. (2029ish)

This means that on that day, MicroStrategy's holdings will be equivalent to winning every remaining block reward until there are no longer any Bitcoin left to be mined.

Expanding on this idea, Proof of work is the digital transformation of energy into a medium exchange, that can store value across time and space. I argue we can reasonably conclude that MicroStrategy's holdings after this date, represents the sum of, the cost of energy on every Bitcoin Node, until all BTC has been mined. (100ish years)

If you think it feels expensive it means you need to spend some more time actually learning about bitcoin, not asking reddit if you should buy. If you‚Äôre asking Bitcoin they‚Äôll say yes. If you ask buttcoin they‚Äôll say no. 

For most people, the best path is NOT to borrow money to buy bitcoin, you should just DCA as much as you can. If you have sum money to put in as lump sum to get off zero, great. If you‚Äôre worried it‚Äôll drop 30% before it goes to a million then do more research. If you think you don‚Äôt have enough to DCA then you may have to make sacrifices elsewhere in your life - that‚Äôs the hard truth.

If you hodl without wavering, in 4-5 years you will be comfortable and in 9-10 years you will likely be able to retire.

There is no short cut. Half the lesson is time preference. Stop dreaming and wondering and complaining about what might have been had you bought bitcoin 10-15 years ago. There‚Äôs lots of things you could have bought to be way better off today. If you DCA‚Äôd daily into Apple, Google, Netflix, Amazon‚Ä¶ so many things you‚Äôd be way up today as well. The problem isn‚Äôt that you didn‚Äôt buy bitcoin, it‚Äôs that you didn‚Äôt buy anything smart. Hindsight is always 20/20.

And the younger generation that is upset they weren‚Äôt old enough in 2010, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have bought it either. There‚Äôs probably something right now you aren‚Äôt buying that in 15 years you‚Äôll say shit. 

It‚Äôs great that you want to save now, only time will be the payoff. The FAQ section of this subreddit is brilliant and I bet 90% of the people asking the same basic questions haven‚Äôt even checked it out.

Bitcoin is either going to a million+ or going to zero. It‚Äôs not going to chop sideways forever. And if it goes to a million it doesn‚Äôt matter if you bought at 95k or 85k. Likewise, if it goes to zero it doesn‚Äôt matter if you bought at $95k or $85k (which it won‚Äôt but just to highlight the fact that it does not matter). What matters is that you bought with discipline and held with discipline.

At the beginning of 2024, I fell into the bitcoin universe and it opened my eyes to so many subjects. I read books, watched hundreds of hours of videos to understand the whole subject (so fascinating) and read this subreddit a lot.

To celebrate a personal project with my brother, I decided to offer him a pizza and pay for it in bitcoin at the only pizzeria in my area of Switzerland that accepts bitcoin. They were worth 57123 sats today. It was a shock to actually make my first useful transaction in bitcoin, understanding that the transaction was validated by the network without a trusted third party or anyone to forbid me.

What an adventure guys (and it's juste the beginning), continue to enrich this subreddit that I read daily.

I first bought bitcoin when it crashed during the initial stages of covid. Seeing the price decrease from 17k to around 4k, I saw it as a buying opportunity and was legitimately hoping to make a quick buck, viewing crypto as a scam. Never ended up selling or converting because of tax implications and general fomo reading $1M price prediction posts. 

The last five years have felt like 30. All that has happened in the world, the immense amount of uncertainty, the stock market crashing, the inevitability of inflation and price gouging screwing over the average person, paper money being printed out of thin air and the deficit growing exponentially in the last 10 years, adoption through ETFs and banks quicker than I ever would‚Äôve imagined‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all made me realize nothing about this is normal, so why should I put my money where you‚Äôd normally put it. 

There will only ever be 21M bitcoin. It‚Äôs the purest scarce asset in existence. It‚Äôs the most simple concept of economics in existence, what you learn in economics 101 on day 1. It‚Äôs financial energy. For the first time in my journey I see $1M as not just a possibility but an inevitability. I am viewing my btc as real money and my fiat as something that will likely vanish away by the time I‚Äôm old. I feel like my world view has shifted and I can see where all this is headed. 

Call it a top signal, but for better or worse, I think we‚Äôre in for some big life changing things. 

Edit: Edited the last sentence to reflect that I don‚Äôt think everything about this is all a positive. It simply just is what it is. "

boo hoo.

so what? 

have you bought a piece of land in Manhattan for 100$? no? does that stop you from wanting your own real estate?

as crazy as it seems, even though you've not bought your sweet digital currency when it was trading below 100$, you're still years ahead oh the majority, who (I assume) will buy shit tons of satoshis when a whole Bitcoin becomes this mythical, unachievable sum.

you already know it's going up. you already know this is where your money is safe. you know no one is ever printing more than what's programmed since day 1.

stop asking yourself if you ever can reach 1, 2, 100 or 1000s of BTC. realize that no matter what you end up having, is always going to be this exact amount out of exactly 21 million.

you're not late to the party. the party has not even started yet, we're barely setting up the audio system to make sure the party will be lit.

Best way to get the most from bitcoin,14,1kd7odg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kd7odg/best_way_to_get_the_most_from_bitcoin/,12,2025-05-02 13:07:53,I don't want to get into how many BTC people have or don't have but I am wondering what are the best ways to get the most from bitcoin holdings.

I'm in the UK so there isn't a lot at this time I can do except hold.

Unlimted OP_RETURN: Explained for everyone.,26,1kd30db,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kd30db/unlimted_op_return_explained_for_everyone/,49,2025-05-02 09:56:36,"## Bitcoin requires data.

There are rules about what that data can be.

Those rules give us wonderful things like multisig and Lightning.



## Capacity for data is limited by blocks.

This limit keeps Bitcoin accessible to everyone by keeping resource requirements low.

Miners try to earn as much money as they can until that data capacity is filled up.

The more data you include in your transactions, the more expensive they are to send because of supply and demand.

## Users run nodes.

Those nodes always relay blocks, and most of them also choose to relay transactions.
Nodes choose to relay transactions for two reasons:

1. To estimate what fee their user should use for their own transactions
1. To guess what will be in the next block, reducing bandwidth and saving resources.

If miners include transactions in blocks that were not exchanged by nodes on the network, it may cause users‚Äô nodes to consume more resources, may result in users paying too much for their own transaction fees, or may result in users paying too little for their own transaction fees, leading to long wait times for confirmation.

**Therefore, the best policy for nodes is to anticipate miners‚Äô behavior and emulate it.**

## Transactions have different kinds of data.

* **Output scripts** must be stored by every node until they are spent. If they are never spent (or unspendable) they are stored forever.

* **Nulldata** is added to transactions being SENT, is ignored by nodes and can be deleted.

* **Witness data** is added to transactions being RECEIVED, is processed by nodes and then can be deleted. Witness data costs less transaction fees than other data, but can only be used after some earlier transaction (paying a fee) has been SENT.

A user may add data to a transaction without caring where in the transaction it is because:

* The data is not intended to be interpreted by Bitcoin‚Äôs consensus rules
* The data is intended to be interpreted by some other software for some reason besides validating the transactions themselves

This behavior can not be prevented by policy alone:

* Bitcoin allows permissionless, uncensorable payments between untrusted parties.
* Users can use Bitcoin to pay miners to include data in blocks.

The less harmful kind of transaction data, if it does not need to be processed by Bitcoin‚Äôs consensus mechanism, is **NULLDATA**. The best way to make Bitcoin Core the most useful, best performing software possible for the most Bitcoin users possible, is to relay transactions without any limit on nulldata."

The momentum of the unknown can be dizzying. It‚Äôs difficult to distinguish if it is freedom, or death beckoning from beyond the indiscernible edge.¬†

Has my preparation until now equipped me for the next revolution? I feel unworthy of the wealth I seek to secure. Maybe, it‚Äôs that I believe affluence is best wielded by those more noble than myself. My misgivings are hardly strong enough to uproot my conviction though.  
  
I was inspired to invest the products of my time, my efforts, and my mind by a charitable neighbor. That was five years ago this Spring. I imagined a victory akin to an ancient orchard, towering, fruitful, and enduring. Since then I have been tortured by glimpses of seedlings peeking past the soil.  
  
My grip is staunch, but my gait is unsteady. I perceive my strategies and schemes to be so correct. Yet, I am perilously steeped in pride, susceptible to hope, and ever questioning if my patience and psyche will remain intact long enough to achieve escape velocity in this endeavor.  
  
The first time around, I fell prey to many mistakes. I found purchase in the first peak just as the mountain began to crumble beneath my feet. I was steadfast in my longing for loftier views when I should have been grateful to have gleaned serenity from the vistas I was lucky enough to arrive at.  
  
Devising a path to surpass the lukewarm was deeply enjoyable and at times, inhibitive to deliberate action. Picturing possibilities, identifying advantages, and theorizing the bridge that would bring vision into reality elicited ecstasy, lunacy, and at the risk of conceit, a glimmer of brilliance.  
  
I pray for vindication. Not often enough to fend off dread or doubt. The gentler residents of my dreamscape might suggest the presence of these two to be healthy in doses, even for the pious. Perhaps especially so. The more vicious of them might scoff at self ascribed piety. I can trust the harsh honesty of a comrade rather than placing stock in the comfort of nurturing adders though, yes?  
  
May the coolness of the shade I toil to erect cultivate clarity without and within."

1 satoshi will be worth exactly 1 cent if bitcoin matches golds market cap,80,1kccrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kccrpn/1_satoshi_will_be_worth_exactly_1_cent_if_bitcoin/,22,2025-05-01 11:18:58,"Here's the math, from what I just googled:

Gold market cap: 21.7 trillion. Bitcoin market cap: 1.92 trillion. 21.7/1.92 = 11.3. So bitcoin would need to grow 11.3 fold to reach gold's market cap. The value of 1 satoshi is currently $0.000948. Multiply this by 11.3 and you get .... drumroll .... $0.0107. Almost exactly 1 cent.   Quite a coincidence that the smallest unit of bitcoin will match the smallest unit of USD when bitcoin is at par with it's closest comparable asset.

It makes me wonder if this played into Satoshi Nakamoto's original decisions on how many bitcoins / satoshi to design the network for. The counterargument to this would be that back in 2009 the market cap of gold was about a quarter of what it is now, so that would mean he designed a satoshi to eventually be worth 0.25 cents at gold parity.

This all started through the Exodus wallet platform, which integrates Cripto InterCambio for swaps. I attempted a crypto-to-crypto transaction. Instead of processing it, they flagged it and demanded KYC. No problem ‚Äî I completed it within 24 hours.

Then came their request for ‚Äúproof of source of funds.‚Äù I explained the crypto was received in a private transaction ‚Äî peer-to-peer, for a personal asset. I went above and beyond and provided notarized documentation to support everything.

Since then, I‚Äôve submitted: ‚Ä¢	A notarized Bill of Sale ‚Ä¢	A notarized Affidavit of Source of Funds ‚Ä¢	Screenshots of messages with the buyer (who they bizarrely keep referring to as ‚Äúthe seller‚Äù) ‚Ä¢	Wallet transaction IDs ‚Ä¢	And a notary receipt to prove everything was made official

Instead of acknowledging or reviewing what I sent, they‚Äôve replied with the same generic responses: ‚ÄúPlease provide official proof of funds.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour case is under review.‚Äù

They‚Äôve now held my funds ‚Äî a significant amount of money ‚Äî for over a month with zero explanation, no clear criteria, and no real human response. I even explained that this delay is affecting my ability to file taxes, and still‚Ä¶ nothing.

From other threads I‚Äôve come across, I‚Äôm clearly not the only person being treated this way. Cripto InterCambio has shown: ‚Ä¢	No accountability ‚Ä¢	No specific feedback ‚Ä¢	No transparency ‚Ä¢	No empathy

This has been mentally exhausting, and I‚Äôm speaking out now so no one else gets stuck like this ‚Äî especially Exodus users who assume integrated services are trustworthy.

If anyone has advice on how to actually escalate this beyond their scripted ‚Äúsupport,‚Äù I‚Äôd love to hear it.

Whats the purchasing power limit of btc,6,1kcu0cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kcu0cv/whats_the_purchasing_power_limit_of_btc/,11,2025-05-02 01:09:48,"Always wondering with this, if btc will behave relatively like gold, itll be a great hedge against currency depreciation like we see with the USD right now actually, but how exactly does that translate into increased purchasing power? 

Hypothetically, if the dollar goes bad and 1.000.000 dollar = 1 dollar in purchasing power in the future, meaning youd need a lot more dollars for the same goods, then btc is worth ‚Äûa lot‚Äú in fiat presumably. 

However if no new value i.e. users, use cases etc. Is added to the network, then how exactly does that translate to a higher purchasing power for coin holders?

Let's say I go to a coffeeshop each day and buy a cup of coffee from there. 
This would mean:
-> Money flows in one direction. 
-> I either have to top up the channel in the beginning with enough BTC for multiple days or do on-chain transactions to top up the channel. 
-> The coffeeshop doesn't really get it's share of BTC until closing the channel, causing another on-chain transaction.
-> The transactions within the channel are less secure than on the main network. 

Maybe I'm getting something wrong, if so please explain. 
Now my questions:
1. I see why lighning is supposed to be reducing transactions, but since money doesn't often flow 2 ways between 2 parties, this is mainly a fancy way of bookkeeping for a prepayment of goods/services, right? 
2. This also means that if the business wants access to it's money it's interested in closing channels as soon as possible after the transaction, right? 
3. Can channels within the lightning network somehow be linked so these disadvantages go away? "

I also currently can't get a HW until later this summer so I need to figure out a way to protect my ass until then.

So I only did cursory research which obviously was not enough when transferring from an exchange to a hot wallet so I am an idiot I know it but I'm trying to fix it. Downloaded and confirmed legit electrum with tails,  quadruple checked the sending address. sent money to the wallet from my exchange....not a lot mind you, few hundred bucks. Transfer successful. 

Thought electrum with a password to access my wallet was enough but I started reading and a lot of people have been robbed of their BTC from electrum hot wallet+windows system they use daily and I realized I used my main and only work computer at home that could and probably has been compromised in the past. So I moved all my BTC out of electrum back into an exchange until I figure out what to do.  i have access to one computer and one phone. I am thinking about totally wiping my hard drive and fresh installs, making a secondary non admin account just for electrum, create a new wallet with a new phrase, send the BTC to it then delete electrum, go into the main admin account and watch the wallet with the public key on a different wallet like sparrow but I haven't figured out how to deposit or withdraw safely though without keeping electrum installed or constant re installs as I put some into BTC every month.

Again. My fault totally and thank goodness I kept reading and realized how big of a mistake I made. I am probably making this harder than it needs to be but can anyone give me a better solution to keep my crypto safe until end of July when I get a HW with what I currently have. I know it's not ideal. please and thank you.

So as you know, if you hold your bitcoin on an exchange, you do not own that Bitcoin because the exchange owns it for you. If the exchange were to go bankrupt like FTX did in 2022, then you would lose your bitcoin.

That's why you should get a hardware wallet or install a wallet that will hold the Bitcoin you own. Of course, this comes with responsibility to keep a secret mnemonic phrase, which is usually stored on paper and refered to as a cold wallet. I recently came up with an idea for a way to store a cold wallet conveniently.

Traditionally, the way people would make a diy solution is by stamping their phrase in washers using metal dyes, and then store the washers in a bolt.¬†

My idea involves a 3D printed bolt that has the right shape, and paper washers instead of metal ones. I thought of using paper washers because you can write with a pencil on it and it's so much easier then stamping each letter with a dye. I did notice though that such a small peice of paper is hard to write on, therefore I optimized the idea even further and made the washers embeded on strips. Now you can hold the strip steady while writing your phrase on it, and you don't need to fiddle with individual washers.

I thought of this idea myself and now I am sharing it with the Reddit community, and also I am making this available as a product. If you want to get a kit, they are available at zedpass.com

I did not opt to get a patent for my idea, therefore it now should be considered un-patentable since it's a product that is in public. The implications of this is that if you want to make your own and sell them, you are free to do so.¬†

Let me know what you guys think of my idea! I always appreciate feedback as long as it is constructive and even if it's negative I still want to hear from you to see what I can improve.

Here‚Äôs some math:

At least 0.01 BTC per account

5,500,000,000 √ó 0.01 = 55,000,000 BTC
Result: 55 million BTC

Problem: More than 2.6√ó the total supply of Bitcoin (21 million BTC) ‚Äî not possible.



At least 0.1 BTC per account

5,500,000,000 √ó 0.1 = 550,000,000 BTC

Result: 550 million BTC

Problem: Over 26√ó the total supply of Bitcoin ‚Äî extremely unrealistic and highlights the scarcity.


Conclusion:
Even 0.01 BTC per global bank account is over 2.5√ó more Bitcoin than actually exists, showing that Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity makes widespread equal distribution at meaningful levels mathematically impossible. .01 BTC ‚âà $1300 CAD



To find how much Bitcoin each of the 5.5 billion accounts could hold if the entire 21 million BTC were evenly distributed:

Calculation:

21,000,000 BTC √∑ 5,500,000,000 accounts = 0.003818 BTC/account


Final Answer:

Each account could hold approximately 0.00382 BTC (or 382,000 satoshis) if Bitcoin were evenly distributed across all active bank accounts in the world.

That‚Äôs roughly $420 CAD

Being European myself, i am seeing and predicting that bitcoin will reach an USD ATH sooner than a new euro ATH. The M2 money supply, so fashionable right now, isn't USD only and taking USD pricing only into account will most of the times lead to an incorrect prediction.

Bitcoin to the moon, all the others to zero. Why? What is it that makes Bitcoin special and unique?

1. **Mathematically sound, nope:** Anyone can create a mathematically sound distributed ledger.
2. **Limited supply, nope:** Anyone can create a cryptocurrency with a limited supply. They could limit it to 19 million Arbitrary Units (tm) to have Even More Scarcity (tm).
3. **It was first, maybe?** First... what? Technically I guess the first truly decentralised, proof-of-work-powered, blockchain-based cryptocurrency? But so what? Does *that* somehow create a stable equilibrium? If so, please explain why.
4. **Hash rate, maybe?** Maybe that's a stable equilibrium. If so, please explain why.

I'm about a month into learning about bitcoin, and I started buying $20 worth of bitcoin each week for a month now.

I thought I was doing it right by buying thru paypal, and just repeating the same process, just buying, not selling, and holding the bitcoin.

But then after a little bit of more research, I came upon the video of ""if I control the bitcoin keys, its my bitcoin, if I dont control the bitcoin keys, its not my bitcoin."" 

Reference: https://youtu.be/F12lpqnug-0?si=gns8kAH3ZKYM1CFd

So I realized that paypal doesnt have these ""private keys"" so therefore I dont own the bitcoin I bought, right? Can someone correct me on this?

Well I searched a few apps and I liked Kraken to buy bitcoin, and Kraken has a Wallet that offers these ""private keys"" to secure the bitcoin.

Im confused on weather I should just keep adding $20 a week and keep it there on Kraken and let it stack to lets say $1,000 worth of bitcoin, and then transfering to Kraken Wallet.

Or do I buy $20 worth of bitcoin each week and then transfer immediately to the Kraken Wallet?

Also, will the bitcoin in Kraken Wallet rise up aswell if bitcoin goes up? 

Sorry if i sould hella stupid asking these questions.

I tried looking for information but I had no luck.

I've got about 7k in FBTC that I hold in Fidelity as of 6 months ago and it's wild to see the ups and downs the coin and the community has been through in that time.

When the price is on the rise the rhetoric here is ""all hail bit coin the way of the future"" but during turbulence and the price going down people are panic selling and down voting people saying chill and hold. This duality is present in every investing community however its just human nature.

 I appreciate all the wealth of knowledge this community gives me every day. So just to give back, my only 2 cence would be if when things get turbulent and it bothers you greatly, consider diversifying your assets. Maybe own half bit coin and half in a reliable index fund or ETF like VT or a sp500 fund. As a new investor  25% of my holdings are in bit coin, 25% are in world wide, and 50% are USA. This personally helps me manage my stress and risk tolerance.  With the US being a cluster I've began to shift more world wide like VT.

Your all great, keep on investing"

I asked if he‚Äôs noticed that when Bitcoin goes up his coins go up but when Bitcoin goes down his coins go WAY down, never actually catching back up to Bitcoin. Ever. Bitcoin literally started at zero. No other ‚Äúcoin‚Äù started at zero. Some start at less than zero but that is a value. There is a price. Zero is zero. He said that alt coins have a better chance of going way up faster than bitcoin which is laughable. Remember when people said ETH was gonna flip Bitcoin. Blaaaaaaaaaahahahaha. That was LAUGHABLE.

'll start this by saying I am blessed beyond blessed in my circumstances, as I know others have it much worse than me but I'm sort of tired of scrounging and scrimping.

I rent a nice one bed apartment and spend a little over 40% my income for my apartment. I tried having a roommate and I tried having a less expensive apartment and I just did not feel safe with my wife and the run down apartment was so bad you couldn't clean it enough. It was just dilapidated, and depressing. Mold issues caused me health problems and I'm so much happier paying more for a decent place.  I wish homeownership was within my means, but when I was 18 I was just trying to afford health insurance and homes in my area were still selling for $275K. Today I'm 27 and I am just dumping money into Bitcoin in hopes of one day having at least a down payment on a house of my own. At least I can pay my rent. I've built up some debt from shiny new things but hey I could drop dead tomorrow. Lord knows my father had no warning when he was crippled from a car accident and my mother had no warning when she had to sacrifice everything to care for us... 

I try to balance life enjoyment and buy BTC. I earn decent money but I have never been afraid to bust my ass. Worked manual labor when I had to, even worked with asbestos because it paid well. If I die sooner because of it so be it. At least I had a sense of pride and enjoyed my time off work.

I'll stack BTC til the day I die. I just wish these pesky bills wouldn't get in the way and I wish I could have some better self discipline.

A reminder-7 thoughts,78,1kb8uwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kb8uwd/a_reminder7_thoughts/,7,2025-04-30 00:24:04,"you hit it big in bitcoin. You want to share the news. A reminder-don't.

1. Safety. There has been a rise in attacks on rich or perceived rich people resulting in not just $$ loss, but loss of life. You have zero upside by people even thinking you have a lot of money that they can take off a phone.

2. Work-many of you have or are currently not just leapfrogging your boss, but your boss's boss's boss. You might have a higher net worth at 25-30 than many in your office do at 45. The guys at 45-50 generally will HATE the idea that you have more $. There is zero upside to telling them...Unless you are negotiating for a higher comp plan and are willing to say ""if you don't pay me x I'm leaving, I have tons of $ and don't need your money"" and you actually mean it. If you are a valuable employee, you might get what you want.

3. Resentment: The middle class disappears day by day and the vast majority of people are moving from this to the poor side, not the rich side. You now having your house free and clear at 43 doesn't make other people happy for you.

4. NGMI-most people are stuck in jobs and lives they hate or tolerate. You having freedom doesn't make them happy. They don't want to be reminded that you had the balls to take the risk, and they didn't.

5. Be wary of lifestyle inflation-I knew a guy who made tons of $ in the mortgage market in 2006 and 2007 and did absurd shit including buying a horse, a green Lamborghini, and spending $400k remodeling his 3,000 square foot house. The horse was sold, the Lamborghini repo'd, and the house went to foreclosure.

6. No one likes a know it all, and refer to #4. You won't make friends or keep friendships by doing this.

7. Value your health -money without health is worthless.

Bitcoin as a Mirror of Human Optimism,2,1kbvumm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kbvumm/bitcoin_as_a_mirror_of_human_optimism/,1,2025-04-30 19:29:34,"Money has always been more than metal, paper, or numbers. At its core, money is a consensus mechanism: a shared agreement among human beings to treat something with no intrinsic utility as if it holds value. That agreement enables trade, coordination, specialization, and progress. But beneath that lies something even deeper: a quiet and profound optimism.

Every time we accept money for something real, we are trading something for nothing‚Äîtemporarily. That only works if we believe that others will return the favor, that the system will hold, that the shared hallucination of value will persist long enough to redeem itself. Money, in this light, is not just a tool of commerce. It is proof that humans trust each other enough to participate in an invisible game that only works if we all keep playing.

Bitcoin distills this principle to its essence. It strips away the narratives, the institutions, the personalities, and even the identities involved in traditional monetary systems. What remains is math, protocol, thermodynamic cost, and a global consensus formed without rulers.

Bitcoin is beautiful not just because it is scarce, secure, or decentralized. It is beautiful because it redefines trust: not as belief in people or institutions, but as a function of time, computation, and transparency. In doing so, it removes the need to trust, while still enabling trustful behavior. It says: you don‚Äôt need to know me, believe me, or share my values‚Äîyou just need to verify.

And we do. Across cultures and borders, people coordinate around Bitcoin. They trade, they save, they build. A consensus emerges from strangers, one block at a time.

This is more than a financial shift. It is a species-level revelation. That we can coordinate without coercion. That we can preserve memory without narrative. That we can write rules into the substrate of the internet itself, and still find cooperation, stability, and shared value.

Bitcoin, in this light, is not a rebellion. It is a mirror. It reflects back the best of what humans are capable of when we let go of control and allow truth to be enforced by structure, not story.

It proves that we are more than the sum of our fears. That even in a trustless system, we will still choose to believe‚Äînot in mythology, but in one another.

Late Grandpa‚Äôs old HDD with Bitcoin on it from 2010. How to recover?,0,1kc8iwn,https://i.redd.it/c1jdc87786ye1.jpeg,41,2025-05-01 08:18:43,"tl;dr: My late grandpa left me this HDD for my 20th birthday, it has Bitcoin on it from 2010 (he kept track of EVERY investment/ financial transaction). How would I recover the Bitcoin and move it to my current wallet?

Slightly longer version:
A few years ago my grandpa passed away. If he wasn‚Äôt buying farm equipment, he was spending every spare dime on stocks, gold, etc. 
I guess at some point in 2010 he discovered Bitcoin, and mined/ bought some. 
Eventually my grandparents bought a new PC and luckily my grandpa saved the hard drive with his Bitcoin on it (which can be seen in the picture). 

My 20th birthday was earlier in April, and after visiting my grandma a week ago, she told me grandpa left this hard drive for me.
I know that there is BTC on here because my grandpa kept a log of EVERY financial transaction he made. Whether it was lending Joe from down the road $10, or buying a new combine for the farm, he logged it ALL. 

With this drive came a piece of paper which has three Bitcoin transaction logs from 2010. (Which I‚Äôm guessing was ripped out of his log book, or just a copy of the logs kept with this hard drive)
That‚Äôs how I know there IS bitcoin on here. 

So now I need to ask; How do I get the Bitcoin off this thing and into my wallet? I haven‚Äôt been able to plug it in to my computer since it doesn‚Äôt use USB, or SATA, but instead uses something called IDE (which is apparently an older connector). 
How can I hook this HDD up to my computer? Would I just be able to find a file with a 12 word passphrase? Should I transfer the Bitcoin to my current Bitcoin wallet? Or would it be safer to stay on the hard drives wallet?

Any help would be appreciated!"

I thought, cool ‚Äî but he's probably treating it like a betting strategy, just like with other shitcoins. Then he added, ""And it‚Äôs true only and only about Bitcoin, if you want to hold for at least 4 years.""

I'm pretty sure if you asked him how Bitcoin works or what exactly it is, he couldn't explain it ‚Äî even as a newbie. But the trust he has in it, probably gained the hard way by losing money on shitcoins, is awesome.

I think even in the best-case scenario for Bitcoin, a huge percentage of people won't really understand it but will still use it ‚Äî just because it feels right.

A while back I started playing with the Crypto.com visa after Ledger Card kicked me out for living in Mexico. 

Anyway. I had .00135373 BTC sitting doing nothing with Crypto.com so I decided to send it to my cold wallet. 

I have never seen a transfer fee like this. 

.0004($30 ish)BTC for that tiny amount WTF is Crypto.com taking some off the top.

In contrast I sold .05 BTC and two months ago and it cost me a whopping .00000698 BTC in fees ($0.67)

IDK if he can see my response to his questions but here is the Idea. 

Services already offer ways that reduce the commission fee to zero. That is why I want to reduce it down to .05 for people purchasing under $1,000,000. Is this going to be really expensive for me, yes, Will it work, idk. But I will try to make it work so you don't have to pay or deal with those kinds of fees and their limits. I want to enable us to buy more liquidity in cryptocurrency than governments or institutions. 

  
As far as FIAT exchange goes, I want to provide safer and reliable FIAT exchange by using Satoshi Coins to provide a stable line of exchange between currencies. In countries like Nigeria they already use cryptocurrency for this reason, although their government outlawed it lol, but they still have wallets with crypto and a hyper inflated economy. Using Satoshi Coins will stabilize and make the transaction easier through bitcoins liquidity which will help boost local economies if someone wants to use it lol. 

  
Are these things going to cost me money yes, will I suffer on a bottom line if I launch this and you use it yes. But I want to create something that is made for this community and with thoughts that will help regular people buy recession proof currencies. Bitcoin is more than just 94k lol, rn at least, it's a way for people to provide stability in currency exchange through its liquidity. The more governments and institutions buy the less recession proof it becomes. I want to make it easier for everyone to buy and sell. "

Technical answer why Bitcoin encryption has NOT been broken yet,0,1kbm12r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kbm12r/technical_answer_why_bitcoin_encryption_has_not/,11,2025-04-30 12:20:41,"The chances of finding the correct seed phrase for a Bitcoin wallet are \*\*effectively zero\*\* under normal circumstances. Here's why:



\---



\### \*\*1. Seed Phrases Are Mathematically Infeasible to Guess\*\*

\- A standard \*\*12-word seed phrase\*\* (BIP-39) is generated from a list of \*\*2048 words\*\*. 

  \- The total number of possible combinations is \*\*2048¬π¬≤ ‚âà 2¬π¬≥¬≤\*\* (a number with \*\*39 digits\*\*).

  \- This is \*\*far larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe\*\* (\~10‚Å∏‚Å∞).

\- A \*\*24-word seed phrase\*\* (BIP-39) has \*\*2048¬≤‚Å¥ ‚âà 2¬≤‚Å∂‚Å¥\*\* combinations ‚Äî even more astronomically large.



\---



\### \*\*2. Brute-Force Attacks Are Impossible\*\*

\- Even if someone tried to guess every possible seed phrase:

  \- It would take \*\*billions of years\*\* with current technology.

  \- For context: The universe is only \*\*13.8 billion years old\*\*.

\- Quantum computing or advanced algorithms would not help, as Bitcoin uses \*\*elliptic curve cryptography\*\* (ECC), which is resistant to 

known attacks.



\---



\### \*\*3. Real-World Practicality\*\*

\- \*\*No one has ever successfully guessed a Bitcoin seed phrase\*\* through brute force or other methods.

\- The only way to recover a lost wallet is by \*\*remembering or finding the original seed phrase\*\*, \*\*private key\*\*, or \*\*backup\*\*.



\---



\### \*\*4. Security of Seed Phrases\*\*

\- A properly generated seed phrase (using a cryptographically secure random number generator) is \*\*unbreakable\*\* by any known method.

\- If the seed phrase is \*\*weak\*\* (e.g., using common words, patterns, or non-random selection), it might be vulnerable to targeted 

attacks, but this is extremely rare.



\---



\### \*\*Summary\*\*

\- \*\*Chances of guessing a seed phrase\*\*: \*\*\~0%\*\* (practically impossible).

\- \*\*Only way to recover a wallet\*\*: Use the original seed phrase, private key, or backup.

\- \*\*Best practice\*\*: Store your seed phrase securely and never share it.



If you're trying to recover a \*\*lost wallet\*\*, the only hope is to find the original backup ‚Äî not to guess the seed phrase."
A hardware wallet is equivalent to a hot wallet,0,1kbvx0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kbvx0i/a_hardware_wallet_is_equivalent_to_a_hot_wallet/,11,2025-04-30 19:32:53,"The philosophy (and protocol) of bitcoin was designed to be very secure and run on general purpose hardware and software.

If you are are paranoid, then the bitcoin protocol lets you sign a transaction that you created with a ""view only"" online wallet, on an offline machine. Then transfer that transaction back to the ""view only wallet"" machine for transmission in a text file that you can view in a text editor.

You can see the airgap with your own eyes.

In the last few years bitcoin promoters have been promoting hardware wallets because its a convenient way to onboard new users and they don't really want to put people off from the technical challenges of self-custodying their own bitcoin.

I find myself finding it difficult to trust in hardware wallets. They 'pretend' to make the airgap but you can't see it because the thing is a piece of ostensibly junk electronics manufactured by a recent startup enterprise that markets it to you for a specific purpose and requires custom hardware, firmware and software, needs to interact with some website that's proprietary and even if its done in good faith can result in collapse of confidence due to someone contaminating just a tiny part of the supply chain in bad faith in my view.

A hardware wallet marketed by a private enterprise is basically saying to you ""we will custody your funds and let you spend it. Trust us"". They are all very young startups.

I see that hardware wallets are sometime promoted on the basis that they have a ""small attack surface"". But as I see it, that is exactly the reason they will be attacked (because they are only used for storing money).

They are very effective honeypot (a highly specific technology invented to attract high value digital assets). But you can't know who created it, who supplied you it, who updated the firmware it's downloading or even if your postman (or some warehouse box stackers & packers) is/are in on a scam.

Contrary to what is promoted, as I see it, you can never really tell if a hardware wallet is genuine. It's the exact same thing as when people say ""not your keys, not your coins"". That thing is connected to the internet whether you like it or not. It's plugged into your ""hot"" machine. You can't see the airgap.

Greg Maxwell (Bitcoin developer) has the measure of the problem:

It‚Äôs tucked away, out of sight from the fiat world‚Äôs noise and chaos. No lights flash. No screens beckon. But etched into its surface, engraved deep into brushed metal, are these words:

‚ÄúI swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.‚Äù

There is no keypad. No fingerprint scanner. The door opens not with credentials, but comprehension. It opens to those who understand what the oath means‚Äînot as poetry, but as protocol.

On the other side lies a terminal. A clean interface. Lines of code. A Bitcoin node humming silently. A Lightning channel routed by will, not by permission. It‚Äôs not a product. It‚Äôs not a service. It‚Äôs freedom in executable form.

There is no customer support line here. No third-party recovery key. No Terms of Service. Only sovereignty, earned through understanding.

Inside, you see others‚Äînot bankers, not bureaucrats, not influencers‚Äîbut engineers, educators, artists, farmers, families. Some run nodes. Some mine. Some write. Some grow. All trade value for value. No one begs. No one steals. All are bound by the unbreakable chain of proof-of-work and voluntary exchange.

There is no inflation. No emergency printing. No policies passed in the night. There is only time‚Ä¶ divided into blocks.

You may enter, but only if you accept what it means to live free. You may participate, but only if you agree: no one owes you access. And you owe no one your labor.

This is not a utopia. This is the base layer.

This is Bitcoin."

Once bitcoin stands tall side by side with the governments force-and-security backed money system, and we have the ability to both store wealth in bitcoin banks and utilize ethical (hopefully) custodial payments solutions

Imagine bitcoin as first a battering ram, annoucing itself by busting open the doors of economic freedom, and then as a doorstop, forcing all of the centralized systems to adhere by the freedom and truth oriented values which initiated and comprises bitcoin, just by virtue of existing

Namely, it seems to me that there are massive advantages to the traditional monetary system, for instance we are able to trace all digital movements of money in crime prevention, and it doesn't come with this enormous continual energy expenditure"

"""Bitcoin is good enough for pension funds"" (Excerpt from book project -- all feedback welcome!)",2,1kb41a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1kb41a5/bitcoin_is_good_enough_for_pension_funds_excerpt/,0,2025-04-29 19:57:48,"Pension funds are among the most conservative financial institutions in the world. Their job is to protect retirement savings‚Äîcarefully, cautiously, and with a long-term outlook.

That‚Äôs why it made headlines in summer 2024 when the State of Wisconsin pension plan became the first U.S. state pension to invest in Bitcoin.

Across the Atlantic, British pension specialist Cartwright encouraged institutional investors to allocate assets into Bitcoin‚Äîand successfully helped Britain‚Äôs first pension fund do exactly that.

In Australia, AMP, a $57 billion superannuation fund, announced a $27 million allocation to Bitcoin‚Äîthe first major digital asset move by an Australian pension.

This is quite remarkable because pension funds are, by design, some of the most cautious and careful people in the world. They‚Äôre not perfect ‚Äì nobody is ‚Äì but they‚Äôre seen by many as the gold standard for risk-averse investing.

Let‚Äôs break down the importance of pension funds adopting Bitcoin:

* **They add legitimacy**. When pension funds buy Bitcoin it signals to the world that Bitcoin is no longer fringe. It‚Äôs becoming part of the mainstream. This helps shake off old stigmas and opens the door for more traditional investors to take a closer look.  
* **Pension funds don‚Äôt chase fads**. They diversify to reduce risk and smooth out returns over decades. They‚Äôre showing that Bitcoin is becoming a serious tool for that diversification strategy.  
* **Confidence in long-term value**. Pension funds only make long-term bets on assets they believe will be around for decades. Their move into Bitcoin shows they see it as more than a speculative bubble‚Äîthey see it as a store of wealth with staying power.  
* **Adapting to a changing world**. The financial world isn‚Äôt standing still. Inflation, interest rate shifts, and evolving global dynamics are changing the game. By exploring Bitcoin, pension funds show a willingness to evolve and use modern tools to protect future retirees.

At their core, pension funds are long-term savings tools built for stability and trust. By allocating even a small amount to Bitcoin, they‚Äôre signaling confidence in its role as a secure, reliable store of value for the future."

I completed the KYC verification process.

I provided clear and verifiable evidence of the legitimate origin of the funds (held since 2020 on Crypto.com).


Despite this, Changelly has not released the funds for more than 20 days or given a specific legal reason. I am concerned that these types of holds contradict the core principles of Bitcoin: self-custody, user sovereignty, and financial freedom.

These types of practices show why we should think twice before entrusting our BTC to custodial services or centralized swaps.

.28 BTC = Top 1 percent Hodler,269,1k9e8t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k9e8t7/28_btc_top_1_percent_hodler/,77,2025-04-27 15:54:54,"Grok answers - Estimated Approx Effective Supply is 16.8 million BTC

Determining the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) needed to be in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of holders ‚Äúforever‚Äù is complex due to Bitcoin‚Äôs uneven distribution, lost coins, and varying holder numbers over time. The estimates below are based on current data (as of April 2025) and assumptions about Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply of 21 million BTC, with adjustments for lost coins and concentration of ownership. These figures are approximations, as precise holder numbers and future distribution patterns are uncertain. All calculations assume the current global population of approximately 8 billion and account for factors like lost coins and whale accumulation.

Key Assumptions

‚Ä¢  Total Bitcoin Supply: 21 million BTC, with ~19.8 million currently in circulation.

‚Ä¢  Lost Coins: Estimates suggest 20‚Äì29% of Bitcoin is lost forever (e.g., inaccessible wallets, Satoshi‚Äôs unspent coins). A conservative 20% loss (4.2 million BTC) reduces the effective supply to ~16.8 million BTC.

‚Ä¢  Uneven Distribution: Bitcoin is highly concentrated, with ~1.86% of addresses holding over 90% of BTC, and the top 10,000 investors (0.01% of holders) owning ~27% of the supply.

‚Ä¢  Holder Population: The number of Bitcoin holders is estimated to be between 50‚Äì200 million globally, far less than the world population, but for ‚Äúforever‚Äù estimates, we assume mass adoption scenarios where up to 1 billion people might hold Bitcoin.

‚Ä¢  ‚ÄúForever‚Äù Context: To be in the top percentiles indefinitely, you need to hold more than the average under a mass adoption scenario, accounting for whale accumulation and lost coins reducing available supply.

Methodology

The estimates are derived by:

1.  Calculating the effective circulating supply (21M - 20% lost = 16.8M BTC).

2.  Estimating the BTC needed to be in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of holders under a simplified model where 1 billion people adopt Bitcoin, then adjusting for real-world concentration based on current blockchain data and whale behavior.

3.  Using posts on X and web analyses for additional context, acknowledging their speculative nature.

Estimates for Top 1%, 5%, and 10% of Bitcoin Holders

Top 1% (Top 1% of 1B = 10M holders)

‚Ä¢  Theoretical Calculation: If 16.8M BTC were evenly distributed among 1 billion people, each would hold 0.0168 BTC. To be in the top 1% (10M holders), you‚Äôd need more than the 99th percentile holder. Assuming a power-law distribution (as Bitcoin wealth follows), the top 1% likely hold significantly more than the average.

‚Ä¢  Adjusted Estimate: Current analyses suggest 0.28 BTC guarantees top 1% status in today‚Äôs market due to concentration and lost coins. For ‚Äúforever‚Äù with mass adoption, whale accumulation (e.g., top 10,000 holders owning 27%) suggests you‚Äôd need ~0.21‚Äì0.26 BTC to stay ahead of 99% of holders, as fewer coins will be available to the masses.

‚Ä¢  Final Estimate: ~0.25 BTC to be in the top 1% forever, assuming 20% lost coins and high concentration.
Top 5% (Top 5% of 1B = 50M holders)

‚Ä¢  Theoretical Calculation: To be in the top 5% (50M holders), you‚Äôd need more than the 95th percentile holder. With 16.8M BTC, the average holding per person (1B) is 0.0168 BTC, but the top 5% would hold disproportionately more due to wealth skew.

‚Ä¢  Adjusted Estimate: Posts on X suggest 0.2 BTC for the top 5% in current conditions, but with mass adoption, the threshold decreases due to wider distribution. Accounting for whales and lost coins, ~0.1‚Äì0.2 BTC is likely sufficient to outrank 95% of holders.

‚Ä¢  Final Estimate: ~0.15 BTC to be in the top 5% forever, reflecting moderate concentration.

Top 10% (Top 10% of 1B = 100M holders)

‚Ä¢  Theoretical Calculation: To be in the top 10% (100M holders), you‚Äôd need more than the 90th percentile holder. The average holding (16.8M √∑ 1B) is 0.0168 BTC, but the top 10% would hold more due to uneven distribution.

‚Ä¢  Adjusted Estimate: X posts estimate 0.026‚Äì0.1 BTC for the top 10% today, reduced by lost coins and whale holdings. For mass adoption, ~0.05 BTC should suffice, as the bottom 90% will hold minimal amounts (e.g., microtransactions or fractional sats).

‚Ä¢  Final Estimate: ~0.05 BTC to be in the top 10% forever, given high whale control and limited supply.

Caveats

‚Ä¢  Dynamic Distribution: Bitcoin‚Äôs distribution may become more or less concentrated over time. If whales consolidate further, thresholds could rise; if adoption spreads, they could fall.
‚Ä¢  Lost Coins Uncertainty: If more than 20% of BTC is lost, thresholds decrease further (e.g., 29% lost reduces supply to ~15M BTC).

‚Ä¢  Holder Numbers: The assumption of 1 billion holders is speculative. If fewer people adopt Bitcoin, less BTC is needed to rank in the top percentiles.

‚Ä¢  Data Limitations: Blockchain data doesn‚Äôt reveal individual owners (one person can control multiple addresses), and exchange-held BTC skews perceptions of retail ownership.

‚Ä¢  Market Volatility: These estimates focus on BTC amounts, not USD value, which fluctuates (e.g., 0.25 BTC ‚âà $23,500 at $94,000/BTC as of April 2025).

Conclusion - 

To be in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of Bitcoin holders ‚Äúforever,‚Äù you‚Äôd likely need ~0.25 BTC, ~0.15 BTC, and ~0.05 BTC, respectively, based on a 16.8M BTC effective supply and mass adoption by 1 billion people. These figures are lower than current estimates (e.g., 0.28 BTC for top 1%) due to lost coins and whale concentration reducing available BTC for the masses."

But my account was recently closed out of nowhere with no explanation. Really bummed out about it but there not much I can do. 

I then downloaded Gemini but the fees are crazy for instant transfers. They want $50 for every $1000 that gets bought and I'm assuming it's like that on the way out as well.  They require wire transfers to fund your account to use advanced trading options. Why you can't just fund you account with a debit card is beyond me. I don't want to wait 1-3 business days to buy crypto. Coinbase fees were high too but at least you could buy Coinbase One and only have to pay a few dollars to cover the spread. Gemini doesn't have that option. 

Long story short I can only use changes available in NY. Im banned from Coinbase and I don't like Gemini and am looking for alternatives if there are any. Thinking about checking out Robinhood even though they don't let people from NY move coins off the platform. Please send advice/suggestions.

I do have a hardware wallet, but *it's* recovery seed is written on some paper which can easily be stolen, so I'm looking for ways to completely mitigate that.

I assume a good alternative and virtual option would be to create an encrypted container file with VeraCrypt and put my recovery seed in a text file in there and only unencrypt it from a live Linux USB on a computer that is physically disconnected from the internet. Backing it up to 2 distinct cloud backup services and making another hard copy on a USB seems redundant enough.

There are only about 900,000 Bitcoin wallets that hold 1 BTC or more - and due to lost keys, forgotten wallets, and long-term holders, the real number of living, reachable ""whole coiners"" is likely closer to 500,000.

As Bitcoin's adoption grows and supply remains capped at 21 million, owning 1 full Bitcoin will soon be seen as an extraordinary achievement, not just a financial asset.

Think about it:

üü† If every millionaire today wanted to own just one Bitcoin, it would be mathematically impossible.

üü† Demand will rise. Supply will not.

üü† The number of whole coiners will continue to fall as Bitcoin is divided, spent, or lost.

Two weeks ago, I was broke ‚Äî no job, behind on my mortgage in a terrifying way.

One morning, I woke up and checked my email. I saw a message from a website claiming I had unclaimed Bitcoin in my account on LocalBitcoins.com, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange that had shut down in 2023.

At first, I thought it was a scam ‚Äî I had never heard of the site. But then I noticed the username they showed, and it was one I recognized and used years ago. Curious, I decided to reset my password and log in.

It turns out that back in early 2013 ‚Äî probably after a long walk in the woods and a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù roll-up ‚Äî I had purchased some Bitcoin on that site, likely after reading an article that sparked my interest.

When I logged in, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes: 4.1 Bitcoin were sitting there.

My heart was racing as I rushed to Google to check the current price.

Since the site was closed, I needed to verify my identity by signing my wallet address with my username. To do that, I had to get a Trezor Safe 5, which I quickly ordered from Amazon. The next day, once it arrived, I transferred the Bitcoin to my own wallet.

Last week, I paid off my mortgage and my car. The rest of the Bitcoin? It‚Äôs staying put for a very long time."

I understand that based on the difficulty the miner will have to find a hash that is smaller than the defined target difficulty. 

Does the Bitcoin client go through the 32bit options of the nonce sequentially or randomly?

If it is sequentially, wouldn't that mean that a faster computer will always end up as the first to solve the block puzzle and get the reward cause a faster computer will always reach X before a slower computer can reach/count up to X?

Why did hardware wallets choose non-hardened paths,0,1k9wgbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k9wgbr/why_did_hardware_wallets_choose_nonhardened_paths/,10,2025-04-28 09:08:56,"I understand that from a usability perspective, having an xpub to generate multiple addresses without touching the hardware wallet ‚Äî and without exposing any private keys ‚Äî is very convenient.

But thinking from a more paranoid security standpoint (and considering that some hardware wallets like Coldcard prioritize security over convenience), wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to fully separate the roles of key generation and transaction signing?

The idea would be to have one device dedicated only to generating wallets (like paper wallets), using BIP39 seeds, and a completely separate device for signing transactions. The signing device could be almost anything ‚Äî even an online phone ‚Äî depending on the value involved, since it wouldn‚Äôt have access to the seed anyway. In this setup, the derivation path should be fully hardened because the private keys themselves would be exposed at the time of signing.

The big advantage here is that the ‚Äúkeys device‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt need to interact with external data at all (like PSBT files in an airgapped model). Its only job would be to generate keys and display them on screen. That simplicity could also make the software easier to verify and audit.

When it‚Äôs time to spend, you simply read the private key into the signing device (whether that‚Äôs hardware, a phone, a computer, etc.) and sign the transaction. After that, the private key becomes useless ‚Äî assuming, of course, you never reuse addresses.

I‚Äôm planning to experiment with this idea using something like a Raspberry Pi as the ‚Äúkeys device.‚Äù But I‚Äôm curious: did I miss something here? Is there any reason beyond usability why even security-focused hardware wallets like Coldcard don‚Äôt follow this model?"

Im not familiar with Strike but I see it's mentioned here frequently so I'd like to hear *why it's the choice for some.

I'd like to here the same for River, Kracken, etc.

I use River because its BTC only. When there's a very high volume of transactions taking place River doesn't go ""temporarily offline"" like awful Coinbase. River also lets you transfer to Cold wallet, or pull cash previously deposited back out after 7 days. Said cash also earns 0.038% interest in *BTC so it's similar to a high yield savings account. I DCA is USD and then buy the dip when its more beneficial. Meanwhile my USD still actively earns 0.038% BTC.

Why not just DCA directly into BTC? Because I've already invested a set amount I'm comfortable with and I like keeping a certain amount liquid for emergency situations. I use River as an interim investment/savings account. If there's a significant dip i have the funds to buy already set aside and I don't touch my primary fiat savings. If the great depression hits it acts as another security layer of liquidity without having to sell my BTC for emergencies."

Bitcoin: The Future of Money?  
  
I handed out pizza and 1 BTC to everyone who showed up.  
  
I had been telling everyone I knew about Bitcoin, helping them install the client, download the blockchain, and send their first transaction.  
  
Then I read a post from a guy who had just graduated MIT. He was planning a road trip across the U.S. only spending Bitcoin. The catch? He needed people to meet him at gas stations and trade gas for BTC, since clerks wouldn't take it.  
  
I told him: ""If you pass through Huntsville, I can meet you and maybe even get you a speaking gig.""  
  
I went to the head of Computer Science at my university and pitched it: this new decentralized currency, the MIT grad on a road trip, the big ideas. He gave me the green light and a lecture hall.  
  
On the day of the talk, I got a few friends to hand out flyers I printed. I tried to hit every building with a tailored message: taxes and monetary policy in the business school, code and crypto in the engineering halls. One guy crumpled the flyer in my face. Others just nodded and walked on.  
  
A few hours before the event, we met Plato, that was the MIT guy's alias. He was skateboarding in the parking lot, wearing a bandana. Totally on brand.  
  
About 20 people showed up, mostly students, a couple faculty. Like I said, I brought free pizza (best way to get college kids to show up). And I gave 1 BTC to everyone who came.  
  
We talked about building an entirely new financial system. Open, borderless, unstoppable. We said there was massive growth ahead. New markets. New ways of thinking about value.  
  
I recorded the whole thing and put it on YouTube. At the end, during Q&A, a professor stood up and said:

To be clear, I've never actually found a /%appdata%/roaming/Bitcoin directory or a wallet.dat in drives I've restored or had the original OS implementation on them on over 300 drives.

But what I have found are legitimate wallet addresses and private keys.  I'm using my own scripts that I've developed and have been testing against false positives and the information is hashing and surprisingly I've come across a few with transactions.  Probabilities appear to be higher than chance.  These are all pulled from binary data.  I've tested the scripts against just raw directories of tens of thousands of files, .doc, .jpg, .zip, etc and they don't yield any hashable data, even raw addresses or just PKs that fit the format, zero.  So what I'm finding in binary is legitimately real and some are on the blockchain.  And yes, accounting for the easy/fake LLLLL... PKs and Trojan Ware traces, there's still ones that don't fit those definitions. 

The mystery to me is why this data is on these drives?  What's a wallet address doing on a hard drive?  What's that private key doing there as well?

Don't worry about buying at the top. You're buying at future lows.,266,1k84s1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k84s1e/dont_worry_about_buying_at_the_top_youre_buying/,44,2025-04-25 23:38:51,"Confirmed I'm a late entrant to BTC, but I am doing my best to rapidly stack sats. With the dollar falling and stocks being unpredictable, what starts to be more obvious is that Bitcoin is something of a ""safe"" haven, made even more solid by the capped number of BTC that can ever be produced. There will be more demand and there will be no more supply, which will continue to push price pressures upward.

So if you're looking at Bitcoin at 95k or 85k or 105k and thinking you don't want to get in at the top, not only is dollar cost averaging the best way to stop chasing a pricepoint, but it is time to start thinking of the current prices not as all time highs, but instead as future lows that may never be available again.

Every one-time all time high has been left in the dust and may not ever be seen again. This means the best time to buy is always until the next time and then you buy again. BTC is cheap at 95k and it will be cheap at 120k and will be cheap at 250k. That's the game. "
Did Satoshi choose 21M as a nod to the inflation of ‚Äòtruth‚Äô itself?,192,1k868gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k868gc/did_satoshi_choose_21m_as_a_nod_to_the_inflation/,111,2025-04-26 01:12:03,"Most people explain Bitcoin's 21 million supply limit by referencing mining rewards and halvings (50 ‚Üí 25 ‚Üí 12.5 ‚Üí etc.).
But if you think critically, you'll notice:

Satoshi could have set block halvings after 200,000 or 250,000 blocks instead of 210,000.

He could have chosen a starting reward of 40, 60, or any other value.

The total supply could have been any number ‚Äî 20 million, 25 million, 50 million ‚Äî depending on simple design choices.

Now, recently I watched a 2007 lecture by Kent Hovind called **""Dinosaurs and the Bible""**.

Originally, I was simply curious about the topic of dinosaurs in the Bible (not Bitcoin, not earth age theories).
But then something jumped out at me:

Starting around **minute 45:00** Kent Hovind explains how, throughout modern history, scientists have kept **increasing** the estimated age of the Earth:

- In 1770, the Earth was said to be 70,000 years old.

- In 1905, it became 2 billion years old.

- In 1969, it was raised to 3.5 billion years old.

- Today, it's 4.6 billion years old.

He jokingly calculates that, based on the historical record, **the Earth's age ""inflates"" by about 21 million years per year.**

Now ‚Äî Bitcoin‚Äôs whitepaper was published **in 2008**, just after this lecture was circulating online.

**Here‚Äôs the theory:**

Satoshi might have seen the irony that not just currencies inflate ‚Äî but even supposed scientific ""truth"" about fundamental things like the age of the Earth inflates over time.
Choosing **21 million** bitcoins could be a subtle philosophical jab:

- A fixed, hard limit against **monetary inflation**,

- And perhaps symbolically, a fixed limit against the **inflation of truth itself**.

In a world where everything ‚Äî money, facts, narratives ‚Äî keeps inflating and losing meaning, Bitcoin stands as a rare creation with **hard, unchangeable scarcity.**

**Important note:**

- I realize there‚Äôs no direct proof.

- But when you look at Satoshi‚Äôs style (hidden references, anti-inflation ethos, philosophical undertones) ‚Äî and the timing (2007 lecture, 2008 whitepaper) ‚Äî it makes this theory very logically possible.

Maybe Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million supply cap isn‚Äôt just about economics...
Maybe it's also a message about truth, scarcity, and resistance to human tendency to endlessly inflate everything.

**Would love to hear what you all think. Has anyone else ever made this connection before?**"

However, I believe we all have a responsibility ‚Äî if you truly believe in the movement ‚Äî to protect it. Crypto is more than just a financial revolution; to me, it‚Äôs a way of life. It‚Äôs interconnected in ways that go far beyond the internet we know today.

We now have the chance to connect and create opportunities like never before, but just like the internet when it first emerged, crypto also carries its own set of dangers. I‚Äôve been in this space for years, and I‚Äôve watched it evolve dramatically. My concern is that people may lose sight of the original core values that sparked the movement in the first place.

I believe the solution lies in more innovation and creativity from the people, integrating crypto into our daily lives. People don‚Äôt care how things work behind the scenes, they just want to know: Does it serve them?

You don‚Äôt need to be a tech genius or business mogul to make a difference. We interact with tech like crypto daily, and its potential to improve our lives is huge. Imagine a world where you choose where your data resides and is encrypted, secure, and free from bad actors. No more data brokers selling our info, allowing people to engage freely without fear.

Small businesses using this technology can build stronger, more direct connections with their communities, fostering trust and real relationships.

We also need to consider education. Teachers can use this tech to teach students not just facts, but how to solve problems in multiple ways ‚Äî giving them a toolkit for life and a broader perspective on the world.

Most importantly, we need to realize that freedom goes beyond what we‚Äôve been told. It‚Äôs time to open our eyes.

Bitcoin is the ‚ÄúUltimate Arrow Security‚Äù which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory.,26,1k83u9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k83u9x/bitcoin_is_the_ultimate_arrow_security_which/,6,2025-04-25 22:43:50,"Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price itself also signals the market‚Äôs assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it‚Äôs status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

This argument rests on Nobel Prize level economic theory that is now widely accepted among central banks and corporate financiers.

Happy Bitcoining. We‚Äôve done it. We have brought sanity and discipline to a multipolar world order.

I researched a lot, but it doesn't seem to be unavailable in Georgia. And there's no info on how long it takes to process that activation.

If anyone ever faced this problem, kindly let me know. Appreciate your help!"

This might sound far fetched but my goal is to eventually be able to retire from my stack and just reinvest.

"Fiat currencies are also credit money, so why not buy Bitcoin on credit too?",15,1k7gqfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k7gqfa/fiat_currencies_are_also_credit_money_so_why_not/,11,2025-04-25 04:28:51,"https://preview.redd.it/6jz4931l9ywe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=294567039870ca4e350b8aead9d3426871aa405c

In 2021, the total crypto market cap peaked at $3 trillion. Fast forward to 2025, and we‚Äôve already hit a new all-time high of $3.73 trillion. That sounds huge, until you realize the U.S. alone prints that much in a single year.

Let that sink in: the entire crypto market, at its absolute peak, is roughly equal to one year of USD creation. Fiat is being inflated at a staggering rate, and yet people still think buying Bitcoin on credit is ""too risky""?

Since the First Industrial Revolution, global GDP has exploded, from a few hundred billion in the 1800s to over $105 trillion in 2024. This growth, driven by fossil fuels, tech, and industry, is now hitting hard limits. The Earth is finite. The current system demands 3% growth forever, but physics, ecosystems, and energy flows don‚Äôt play that game.

[Assuming a steady 3&#37; annual growth rate, the global economy would double roughly every 24 years. That means by 2048, global GDP could reach around $218 trillion.](https://preview.redd.it/imzppr36a2xe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ec1e3de39589f2749bcb307774d9a78292e3ec)

What does this mean? Fiat currencies are already credit-based, backed by debt, endless printing, and faith in perpetual expansion. It‚Äôs a system built on borrowed time.

So here‚Äôs the controversial take: if you're going to live in a world built on debt, why not use that to your advantage? Buying Bitcoin on credit isn‚Äôt just speculation, it‚Äôs a hedge against the slow implosion of a debt-based fiat system.

No, this doesn‚Äôt mean max out your credit cards recklessly. But intelligently using leverage to exit a doomed system might not be as crazy as it sounds. Especially when the alternative is watching your savings silently melt under inflation.

Is it risky? Sure. But so is staying in fiat."

A little bit of Bitcoin can go a long way....,50,1k79851,https://i.redd.it/lj8hit42yvwe1.png,1,2025-04-24 20:40:26,"CPI, PPI, Core, Super-Core, PMI, it is all BULLSHIT.  

Inflation is very simply the growth of the money supply, commonly referred to as M2.  

You will never hear that on  Bloomberg, CNBC, FoxBiz, etc as it does not fit the narrative of the advertiser paymasters.  

The chart below I pulled off of St. Louis Fed website and simply had AI calculate the rates for the time period 1980-2025.  Bottom line your investments need to yield 6.7% POST TAX to tread water.  Less than that you are falling behind.  $100K today needs to be $138K by 2030 just to buy the same loaf of bread. 

Do you keep all your money in T-Bills?  HELL NO.  Do you keep it in cash?  HELL NO.  Would you put is all in XYZ Corp Stock?  HELL NO.  Would you put it all in Bitcoin? HELL NO. I might but I am nuts...

So what do you do?  How do you boost your yield but keep your investment safe at the same time?  

There is an answer: add a little bit of Bitcoin.  

By simply adding X% of Bitcoin to your favorite investment you drastically increase your Sharpe Ratio (risk adjusted return). I am not here to tell you how much BTC to add but you need some. Do some homework on it.  Ask you financial advisor.  Literally one digit of Bitcoin can make the difference between BEATING INFLATION or being BEAT BY INFLATION. "

Credit system on a Bitcoin standard,11,1k7ekq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k7ekq1/credit_system_on_a_bitcoin_standard/,19,2025-04-25 01:52:11,"I often find myself wondering about credit systems on a Bitcoin, true sound money standard. 

The below is a bit of a brain dump with the hope of understanding the thoughts of others on this topic.

Now to be clear, this is not something that concerns me personally, because I personally wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to take credit for something that I can actually save up for, knowing the purchasing power of my savings is going to be preserved, probably even rise!

And I would hope that most people would feel this way too, once they realise their purchasing power isn‚Äôt being stolen from them. However, I‚Äôm not naive to the reality that the world is addicted to credit, and there will be demand for it, at least initially. So, how do you all feel about this?

My concern for the masses is that, on a sound money system, taking credit recklessly is going to get you burned. Unless the credit you‚Äôre taking is going to productive use, to generate greater future returns, it will wipe you out, because you‚Äôre going to have to pay back more in real value. 

Granted, there should be less need to take credit across the board, even for homes, because as they stop being used as a store of value out of necessity, they fall back to their true utility value, and you can just save up for one. If they‚Äôre still to overpriced, lower demand will force prices down further.

But the reality is there will be demand for it, at least initially, and financial institutions will still be desperate to hold onto that business. The way I look at it right now is, it‚Äôll be an adjustment, and unfortunately a lot of people will learn the hard way that taking credit without due consideration, or without the intention of putting it to productive use, will cause them harm. And really that‚Äôs how it should be, if your taking credit it should be because the anticipated productivity increases are expected to provide monetary benefits that would allow you to pay off the credit + provide an ongoing increase in income.

I guess like all things, people will do what they do, get burned, and learn over time"

"how in theory would ""paper bitcoin"" enter the ETF space?",0,1k7ln7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k7ln7l/how_in_theory_would_paper_bitcoin_enter_the_etf/,14,2025-04-25 08:59:48,"This is not an endorsement of the ETF's, before you auto-rage-respond ""Just buy real bitcoin"", read my full question.  (I do actual cold storage the majority of my holdings)

I listen to a lot of bitcoin podcasts, some more well put together than others.  And a small talking point I have heard a few times is the possibility of deceit/fraud/etc, in the form of ""paper bitcoin"" when investing in the ETF's.  However none of those podcast hosts actually take the time to explain how a nefarious actor could in practice do something deceitful like this.  I don't know if these hosts are just fear mongering, throwing out buzzwords, are extremely uneducated....or if I am?  However unlike these hosts, I am always willing to hear another's point of view and consider the possibility that I am incorrect or uneducated about a particular topic.

  
In my knowledge of the traditional finance system, the redemption creation process for an ETF issuer is a highly regulated and standardized and auditable process.  (Bitcoiners love to hate on the SEC but they have done some things that protect the customer).  Furthermore, given that the ETFs are so new, and it was a very contentious process to get them approved, it is reasonable to believe that they are going to be subject to a higher level of scrutiny.  

  
With that being said.  Is the possibility of a bitcoin ETF investor getting screwed a real threat due to so called ""paper bitcoin""?  And how would that mechanics of that work?  Because in my mind (correct me if I am wrong) the very oversimplified process would play out like the following:

1. Consumer buys more bitcoin ETF

2. ETF issuer ""I need to purchase more actual bitcoin as part of the regulated creation process with my exchange partner""

3. Exchange partner ""ah shit, liquidity is drying up, we don't have it, here is an IOU, don't tell anyone, I promise we will square up with you tomorrow""

4.?????

  
It seems like the ability to introduce fraud into the system starts at step 3, however it would be caught relatively quickly.  In which case some regulatory body steps in and says ""you are short, makes your books straight ASAP or we are going to fine you"".  In which case ETF issuer and exchange partner say OK, we are purchasing the required amount at market rate asap and Boom...price goes up.  

  
Can someone comment on my questions and whether there is a legitimate concern of so called paper-bitcoin by investing in the ETFs?"

EDIT:  OK I still don't know why the address that Ledger Live shows as the address my BTC is stored at as having no BTC when I check it on the blockchain tools, but I have good news.

I installed Sparrow Wallet on a tablet PC running a fresh install of Kubuntu and connected my Nano S to it and let Sparrow sync with it.   It gave me the entire transaction history for my Nano and all the BTC it stores is accounted for by Sparrow Wallet.

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†April 2026 (t = 13.25): 51.5 oz/BTC

‚Ä¢	‚Å†April 2027 (t = 14.25): 95.2 oz/BTC

 * Illustrative Average Trend ONLY: Ignores real volatility/cycles. Actual chart differs drastically.
 * No Predictive Value.
 * NOT Financial Advice.

This model isolates the severely smoothed trend; actual market behavior is dominated by volatility around this average.

I bought a couple Bitcoin about 10 years ago, heard not your keys not your coins, especially with the MT GOX thing, so at that time bought a ledger nano s to store them on as that was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù for us non-technical folks. Moved them to that and haven‚Äôt touched it since. 

Kinda been outta the space since then, but now that it‚Äôs been a while and that small investment has grown substantially I want to move those couple coins to something more secure, especially with all I‚Äôve heard about ledger.

Some say use sparrow, others say ledger live but then others say don‚Äôt use ledger live. I‚Äôm not smart enough to figure all that out and it‚Äôs a significant amount of money, and I don‚Äôt want to do something stupid.

How would you guys go about moving the coins from the ledger nano s which I‚Äôm guessing may need an update, but I‚Äôd prefer not to do that if possible. I have my access pin and my seed phrase, but do not want to put the seed phrase in anywhere as I know that‚Äôs a big no-no.

I‚Äôm planning to invest¬†**100% of it into Bitcoin**¬†and hold long-term.  
I see it as low-interest leverage + time on my side. I get the student  loan paid to me annually so 3x **8216‚Ç¨.** I haven't yet decided if I should lump buy or dca.

**What is \/r/btc?**

The \/r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin. It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy \/r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.

Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which led to](http://archive.is/0G8az) thousands of redditors being banned from the \/r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc. For a run-down on the history of censorship, please read [A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/bitcoin by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and [/r/Bitcoin Censorship, Revisted by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64). As yet another example, \/r/bitcoin [censored 5,683 posts and comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7414nf/september_2017_stats_post/) just in the month of September 2017 alone. This shows the sheer magnitude of censorship that is happening, which continues to this day. [Read a synopsis of /r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) to get the full story and a complete understanding of [why people are so upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/5gvqf6/and_now_for_something_completely_different_the/) with \/r/bitcoin's censorship.

**Why is censorship bad for Bitcoin?**

As demonstrated above, censorship has become prevalent in almost all of the major Bitcoin [communication channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mxov4/wtf_north_koreas_cgc_tries_to_control_bitcoin/dc78hwl/). The [impacts of censorship in Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cxx8t/the_impacts_of_censorship/) are very real. ""Censorship can really hinder a society if it is bad enough. Because media is such a large part of people‚Äôs lives today and it is the source of basically all information, if the information is not being given in full or truthfully then the society is left uneducated [...] Censorship is probably the number one way to lower people‚Äôs right to freedom of speech."" By censoring certain topics and [specific words](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vr7ij/partial_list_of_words_that_automod_removes_from/), people in these Bitcoin communication channels are literally being brain washed into thinking a certain way, molding the reader in a way that they desire; this has a lasting impact especially on users who are new to Bitcoin. Censoring in Bitcoin is the direct opposite of what the spirit of Bitcoin is, and should be condemned anytime it occurs. Also, it's important to [think critically](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5txje0/edward_snowden_the_answer_to_fake_news_is_not/) and [independently](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/), and have an open mind.

-----

**Why do some groups attempt to discredit \/r/btc?**

This subreddit has become a place to discuss everything Bitcoin-related and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem. Since this subreddit is one of the few places on Reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely, truth is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship. Because of this freedom, people and groups who don't want you to hear the truth with do almost anything they can to try to stop you from speaking the truth and try to manipulate readers here. You can see many cited examples of cases where special interest groups have gone out of their way to attack this subreddit and attempt to disrupt and discredit it. [See the examples here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/)

-----

**What is the goal of \/r/btc?**

This subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin. \/r/btc honors the spirit and nature of Bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about Bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https://modlogs.fyi/r/btc). This subreddit does have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index#wiki_rules_for_this_subreddit_.28also_in_the_sidebar.29) as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own. Make sure to **[read the /r/btc wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index)** for more information and resources about this subreddit which includes information such as the benefits of Bitcoin, how to get started with Bitcoin, and more.

-----

**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is a digital currency, also called a virtual currency, which can be transacted for a low-cost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin also powers the blockchain, which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever. There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper to further understand the schematics of how Bitcoin works.

-----

**What is Bitcoin Cash?**

Bitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is an updated version of Bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing Bitcoin Core (ticker symbol: BTC) for years. Bitcoin (BCH) is just a continuation of the Bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption. You can read more about Bitcoin on [BitcoinCash.org](https://bitcoincash.org/) or read [What is Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoin.com/info/what-is-bitcoin-cash) for additional details.

-----

**How do I buy Bitcoin?**

You can buy Bitcoin on an exchange or with a brokerage. If you're looking to buy, you can [buy Bitcoin with your credit card](https://buy.bitcoin.com/) to get started quickly and safely. There are several others places to buy Bitcoin too; please check the sidebar under brokers, exchanges, and trading for other go-to service providers to begin buying and trading Bitcoin. Make sure to [do your homework first](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-exchange/) before choosing an exchange to ensure you are choosing the right one for you.

-----

**How do I store my Bitcoin securely?**

After the initial step of buying your first Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to secure your Bitcoin. Knowing which Bitcoin wallet to choose is the second most important step in becoming a Bitcoin user. Since you are investing funds into Bitcoin, choosing the right Bitcoin wallet for you is a critical step that shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly. [Use this guide to help you choose the right wallet for you](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-wallet/). Check the sidebar under Bitcoin wallets to get started and find a wallet that you can store your Bitcoin in.

-----

**Why is my transaction taking so long to process?**

Bitcoin transactions typically confirm in ~10 minutes. A confirmation means that the Bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network through the process known as mining. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. Transactions are included in blocks.

If you have sent out a Bitcoin transaction and it‚Äôs delayed, chances are the [transaction fee](https://bitcoinfees.cash/) you used wasn‚Äôt enough to out-compete others causing it to be [backlogged](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h). The transaction won‚Äôt confirm until it clears the backlog. This typically occurs when using the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain due to poor central planning.

If you are using Bitcoin (BCH), you shouldn't encounter these problems as the block limits have been raised to accommodate a massive amount of volume freeing up space and lowering transaction costs.

-----

**Why does my transaction cost so much, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be cheap?**

As described above, transaction fees have spiked on the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain mainly due to a limit on transaction space. This has created what is called a fee market, which has primarily been a premature artificially induced price increase on transaction fees due to the limited amount of block space available (supply vs. demand). The original plan was for fees to help secure the network when the block reward decreased and eventually stopped, but the plan was not to reach that point until some time in the future, [around the year 2140](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Controlled_supply#Projected_Bitcoins_Long_Term). This original plan was restored with Bitcoin (BCH) where fees are typically less than a single penny per transaction.

-----

**What is the block size limit?**

The original Bitcoin client didn‚Äôt have a block size cap, however was limited to 32MB due to the Bitcoin protocol message size constraint. However, in July 2010 Bitcoin‚Äôs creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a [temporary 1MB limit](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/103/tree//trunk/main.h?diff=515630145fcbc978e39dbaa5:102) as an anti-DDoS measure. The temporary measure from Satoshi Nakamoto was made clear three months later when Satoshi said the block size limit can be [increased again by phasing it in](https://archive.is/L5yvP#selection-3315.0-3315.7) when it‚Äôs needed (when the demand arises). When introducing Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list in 2008, Satoshi said that [scaling to Visa levels](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) ‚Äúwould probably not seem like a big deal.‚Äù

-----

**What is the block size debate all about anyways?**

The block size debate boils down to different sets of users who are trying to come to consensus on the best way to scale Bitcoin for growth and success. Scaling Bitcoin has actually been a topic of discussion since Bitcoin was first released in 2008; for example you can read how Satoshi Nakamoto was [asked about scaling here](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) and how he thought at the time it would be addressed. Fortunately Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and by the year 2013, scaling Bitcoin had became a hot topic. For a run down on the history of scaling and how we got to where we are today, see the [Block size limit debate history lesson post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61mxuj/block_size_limit_debate_history_lesson/).

-----

**What is a hard fork?**

A hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol. In this case, Bitcoin diverges from a single blockchain to two separate blockchains (a majority chain and a minority chain).

-----

**What is a soft fork?**

A soft fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules, but the difference is that nodes don‚Äôt realize the rules have changed, and continue to accept blocks created by the newer nodes. Some argue that [soft forks are bad](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7) because they trick old-unupdated nodes into believing transactions are valid, when they may not actually be valid. This can also be defined as coercion, as [explained by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html).

-----

**Doesn't it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size?**

Some argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space, that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually, giving way to centralization. This is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization; although it has been shown that the [current level of decentralization will remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fyve1/fallacy_the_key_to_bitcoins_decentralization_is_a/) with or without a block size increase. It's a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes. The reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node (even at 1MB) will be doing it. So whether it's 1MB, 2MB, or 32MB, the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it. If the block size limit is removed, this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators. [Decentralization is not a metric, it's a tool or direction](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/693537120351293440). This is a good video describing the direction of [how decentralization should look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S1IqaSLrq8).

Additionally, the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond 1MB [has been studied](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cornell-study-recommends-4mb-blocksize-bitcoin/) with results showing that up to 4MB is safe and will not hurt decentralization ([Cornell paper, PDF](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf)). Other papers also show that no block size limit is safe ([Peter Rizun, PDF](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/feemarket.pdf)). Lastly, through an informal survey among all top Bitcoin miners, many agreed that a block size increase [between 2-4MB is acceptable](http://archive.is/U3dqr).

I think BTC is the best thing we have to fight central planners or central banks, or excessive taxation and limiting the power of authoritarians.  



Bitcoin (BTC) current priorities

1) Prioritize diversity of clients, and lots of nodes  (small blocks)

2) Initially focus on Store of Value -> Get government adoption

3) Use Base layer for permission less transaction, medium of exchange moved to  Layer2 lightning

4) Fight spam or non - monetary functions of Bitcoin  (Avoid Blockchain bloat and avoid alternative use cases creeping into Bitcoin and competing with block space)

 

Here is the new shift of BitcoinCore

1) BitcoinCore is embracing spam and taking away individualism (ability to filter)    

2) BitcoinCore is embracing spammers rather than fight them





Bitcoin Core is more and more corrupted away from Bitcoins original OG Cyberpunk principals.

Votes would be weighted by computational power, not by nation-state borders or corruptible institutions. No central authority. No possibility of fake votes. Absolute transparency.

Yes, this would favor those with computing power ‚Äî just like Bitcoin favors miners ‚Äî but maybe that‚Äôs the price of a truly secure, global law. Better than corrupt bureaucrats?

As a Bitcoin holder, I‚Äôm curious: has anyone seen or built a similar on-chain automation tool for Bitcoin mainnet (or for WBTC on Ethereum)? Are there technical hurdles around UTXO management or liquidity that explain why bots haven‚Äôt taken off for BTC the way they have on EVM?

Please correct me if I'm wrong.,10,1kbhfsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1kbhfsi/please_correct_me_if_im_wrong/,100,2025-04-30 09:08:24,"Here's my logic.

Bitcoin isn't being used as intended (as a peer to peer cashless network for everyday transactions) because of the block size, settlement time etc.

But it IS being used as a store of value, as a hedge against inflation. Especially as currencies all over the world are inflating like crazy, everywhere and this is happening faster and faster.

Now I don't see pretty much any country getting off of their fiat currency any time soon. So it tracks that more and more people will turn to bitcoin as their own currencies keep losing value, which will maintain/increase the value of BTC.

The risk of a 51% attack seems (to me) to be low, as it's would be so expensive to accumulate enough.. to just then destroy it... Takes an idealogical motive, not an economic one.

TLDR: I think BTC is a great hedge against inflation, I think it's great for security of wealth and the ability to carry wealth.

Am I missing something?

Thank youu!"

Securities fraud, in New York, hurts the beating heart of the whole New York economy.

When New Yorkers get scammed, it hurts the NY brand.

To protect it's markets, New York has The Martin Act. Passed in 1921, it grants the New York Attorney General expansive law enforcement powers to conduct investigations of securities fraud and bring civil or criminal actions against alleged violators.

The NYAG can bypass the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and ALL other federal agencies. Because these subpoenas are purely ‚Äúinvestigatory,‚Äù witnesses subpoenaed by the attorney general cannot claim a right to counsel or the right against self-incrimination.

So if you've been hurt in a meme coin accident, don't hesitate, [call the TOP DOG](https://ag.ny.gov/contact-attorney-general-letitia-james)‚ÄïAttorney General Letitia James is there to fight for every dollar.

With unprecedented corruption and bribery occurring openly in the United States, the Office of the New York Attorney General is there to protect New Yorkers, if they speak out.

***

For **legitimate DeFI** builders that are not scamming, the cop in the office of the NYAG and the Martin Act also concern you.

If the AG [is attacked](https://apnews.com/article/letitia-james-trump-investigation-df3dcb78a464d521edb444681e990d37) and replaced with a corrupt operative, the Martain Act could be abused.

The statue of limitations on The Martin Act is six (6) years, meaning if the office was politicized or corrupted, it could be weaponized against the entire legitimate blockchain space, leaving only scams."

Proof of Work in Cryptocurrency is Based on Marx's Labor Theory of Value,0,1kb0ps9,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1kb0ps9/proof_of_work_in_cryptocurrency_is_based_on_marxs/,40,2025-04-29 17:19:59,"Every cryptocurrency that uses proof of work algorithms is based on Karl Marx's Labor Theory of Value. Namely, proof of work makes each unit of the currency arbitrarily difficult to obtain, immune to forgery, and as an ancillary benefit, resistant to censorship. Marx says the work expended to mine the coins is what gives them their value, since there is no other way to create them and it requires human effort and energy. 1.2 Billion Gigawatts of electricity are burned up every day for BTC mining alone, confirming the validity of proof of work. Therefore I am curious why Marx's LTV seems to get bashed routinely by BTC Maxies. Is this another example of their hypocrisy and ignorance of economics? Or has LTV really been discredited? I have my doubts about modern economic theories, MMT and Keynes theories have gotten us to the brink of a massive financial collapse and/or hyperinflation after all.

Also, in another twist of irony, the Maxies I see arguing against Labor Theory of Value seem to be blissfully unaware that LTV is one of the main reasons that fiat money has NO intrinsic value. Hardly any labor is expended when the Fed presses that ""ONE TRILLION BRRRR"" button, making it too easy to debase away any value stored in the USD. And as we're seeing today, USD value is eroding quickly because of a few words from an Orange Guy. Of course there are always Men With Guns...

EDIT: to anyone who wants to argue about Marx's critique of capitalism, head on over to r/Socialism please. This thread is only about Marx's Labor Theory of Value and how it relates to Proof of Work Mining on cryptocurrencies. "

If it really pops off, BTC probably holds steady or grinds up slowly, but the real fireworks would be happening in the lower caps. Same old cycle, Bitcoin builds the base, then money flows down the chain looking for bigger moves. Nothing new, but it feels way faster this time around.

One thing I‚Äôm wondering though is that with how quick everything moves now, especially on chains like Solana, is it even realistic to trade without some kind of bot helping you?

It felt like a sci-fi disaster movie set inside the blockchain.

In the dream, I wake up, grab my phone, and instinctively open CoinGecko‚Ä¶
Everything is grayed out.
No charts. No prices. No volume.
Just a banner:
‚ÄúBitcoin network suspended. Transaction index error.‚Äù

What?

I check CoinMarketCap‚Äîsame thing.
I try to open my wallet‚Äîit spins endlessly.
No balances load. No transactions appear.
Just a red warning:
‚ÄúNetwork temporarily halted. Duplicate TXIDs detected. Awaiting consensus fix.‚Äù

Then I open Twitter (or X, whatever)‚Äîand it‚Äôs total chaos.
People are freaking out. Devs are posting cryptic messages. Some say the unthinkable:

> ‚ÄúA double transaction with the same TXID has entered the mempool.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe network doesn't know which version is real.‚Äù
‚ÄúMiners have halted. Blocks stopped 34 minutes ago.‚Äù



Some say it‚Äôs a SHA-256 collision.
Others claim quantum hackers.
Even Satoshi's old GitHub account is suddenly active.

I saw screenshots of a transaction ID pointing to two different spends. It was like looking into a black mirror‚Äîtwo realities inside one hash. And that broke Bitcoin‚Äôs brain.

Nodes were going offline. Exchanges locked withdrawals.
Somehow, the entire global financial system had no plan for ‚ÄúBitcoin split by identity crisis.‚Äù

I woke up in a cold sweat and actually checked the price. Still there. Still safe. But for a few moments, it felt real.
Like the crypto version of Y2K‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs 2025, and one bug means game over.

Is this even possible? Can Bitcoin really suffer from something like this? Or was my brain just deep-diving into code anxiety?

Would love to hear what the techies and node runners think. What‚Äôs the worst thing that could realistically happen?

According to Broyles, the energy required to mine the final singular Bitcoin will surpass the combined energy it took to mine the first 20,000,000 BTC. He predicts that producing the final Bitcoin could consume energy over the entire first third of the 22nd century.


1.15 million Bitcoin left to mine
Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is pegged at 21 million coins. Of the 21 million total Bitcoins, 19.85 million have already been mined, leaving approximately 1.15 million remaining.


Because of Bitcoin‚Äôs halving occurrence, it will most certainly take years to mine the remaining coins. The last Bitcoin to be produced and released into circulation is predicted by the end of the year 2140, ensuring that the Bitcoin mining process slows down in the market over time.


After mining is completed, no new Bitcoins will be released into the market. The miners will then use transaction fees to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain.

Bitcoin was trading at $94,181 at the time of writing, having previously reached an all-time high of $109,114 in January."

BTC/XAU = y(t) = 0.015 .

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†April 2026 (t = 13.25): 51.5 oz/BTC

‚Ä¢	‚Å†April 2027 (t = 14.25): 95.2 oz/BTC

‚Ä¢	‚Å†April 2028 (t = 15.25): 176.1 oz/BTC

--- CRITICAL CAVEATS ---
 * Illustrative Average Trend ONLY: Ignores real volatility/cycles. Actual chart differs drastically.
 * No Predictive Value.
 * NOT Financial Advice.

This model isolates the severely smoothed trend; actual market behavior is dominated by volatility around this average.

A very bitcoin auction... just don't blink.,9,1k6oh1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k6oh1p/a_very_bitcoin_auction_just_dont_blink/,0,2025-04-24 05:02:51,"An auction is a set of rules or procedures to accomplish three things simultaneously. Those things are:

1. Price discovery: determining the fair market price. 
2. Transfer the title of ownership. 
3. Determine the buyer, or who will be paying the seller. 

There's a group of people, the bidders, who know the auction rules to participate to fulfill their economic needs. There can be different rules for different types of things. 

There are FOUR common problems that can result from a typical auction: 

- Buyers not paying, 
- Buyers not picking up,
- Seller not getting paid because buyers didn't pay, 
- And finally, sellers not collecting unsold property. 

But since Bitcoin Cash has a very capable scripting system, we could have a perfect auction that accomplished the three functions needed and prevented the four property/payment problems perfectly. 

With CashTokens, what we need is one transaction that remits payment to the seller, and releases the token for the buyer, while allowing anyone to bid at any price. 

Auctions take time. Bidders need to know that something will be sold, & about when. Bidders need to research authenticity, the current market and plan their overall strategy.  

In a Dutch Auction, a successively lower ASK is called until someone bids. The first and only bidder wins the lot. 

A Dutch auction may sometimes transition into an English auction. In an English auction, the ASK goes up in regular increments with successive bids from different parties until no one wants to bid higher and an auctioneer says ""sold"". 

So to do an English auction in bitcoin, we'd need to keep track the current high bidder, their bid and (since we can't put that info on the NFT being sold), we'd need some way to link or refer a bid to the token utxo. 

In a bitcoin virtual machine, there is no global state like with an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). While it's possible to write an [English-like auction system](https://github.com/BitCANN/contracts/blob/main/README.md) with CashTokens, a Dutch auction is much more straight-forward because it can be done in one transaction with no need to keep track of the bid, bidder, or link to the lot being sold. 

Again, the rules for a Dutch Auction are:

- Start at some very high price.
- Go down in regular increments.
- The first bid wins. 

Dutch auctions are great at getting things sold‚Äïthey're great for throughput. 

If we use the same ridiculous price (maybe 50 BCH) for every lot, then the only state we need to keep track of is time, which is already available on every bitcoin output since 2017. 

So what do we need to say in bitcoin to make this auction happen? What does the auction contract need to check? 

- An output MUST be a version 2 transaction (for timelocks).
- The output value MUST must be higher than the ASK. 
- An output MUST pay the seller the current ASK. 
- If using block height as time, we need some checks for that.

We don't care where the buyer sends their new token, that's unrestricted, or restricted by consensus rules already. 

To list tokens for sale, a seller could send their tokens to a contract where the ASK is always 50 BCH divided by the age of the unspent output in blocks, and anyone would be able to create a transaction spending their tokens and paying the seller the fair market price for their token.  

The above logic in CashScript (// BitcoinScript): 

    contract DutchAuction(

      // Opening ASK 
      int open,

      // LockingBytecode of the consigner, the address receiving payout
      bytes recipientLockingBytecode

    ) {

      // 
      function buy() {
           
        // Require version 2 for BIP68 support
        // OP_TXVERSION OP_2 OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY 
        require(tx.version == 2, ""must use v2 transaction""); 

        // The minimum relative age is the opening bid divided by the ask.
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTVALUE OP_DIV 
        int requiredAge = open/tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].value;

        // The age in blocks must be in a valid BIP68 range
        // ffff00 OP_OVER OP_GREATERTHAN OP_VERIFY 
        require(65535 > requiredAge, ""open over value (required age) must be less than 65535"");   

        // Enforce the minimum age. 
        // OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP 
        require(this.age >= requiredAge, ""bid too low"");

        // Check that each output sends to the consignor
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUAL
        require(tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].lockingBytecode == recipientLockingBytecode, ""must payout consigner"");
        
      } 

    }

The above code works out to 26 bytes for the auction logic on the blockchain. 

It looks like this:

    c2529c69007ac0cc9603ffff005179a069007ab275c0cd517a87

With the balance of the auction contract, showing the age of the lots, no special service is needed to calculate the ASK. It's decentralized, use your own computer.

After 1 block the ASK is 50 BCH. After 10 blocks the ASK would be 5 BCH. After a week (~1000 blocks) the price would be 0.05. After a month the price would be 1.25M sats. After a year the price would be 76k sats, which would be about as low as it goes. 

There's a lot of stuff left out: 

- no commission
- no premiums 
- no auctioneers
- no volley of bidders
- no cancellations 
- no welching
- no unsold property (of value above 76k sats) 

Bidders would have to pay standard transaction fees to miners. 

But sellers don't get a free ride. Sellers that no longer wished to auction their property could cancel by buying their lots back. They pay by expressing what price they believe is too low, just like everyone else. They'd have to pay themselves the current ASK, and pay miners a fee for doing so. 

It would be easy for a seller to list 10 NFTs (or 1000) using a single contract address. The seller's auction contract is just a token-aware bitcoin cash address. They could send tokens to it from any wallet with support for sending to such a CashToken aware address. 

The auction contract is designed for arbitrage. A transaction could be built simultaneously buying purchasing a fungible token at auction while swapping the same token out for Bitcoin Cash on a compatible dex like cauldron. 

The parameters to find an auction contract on-chain are just the start price and the seller's address. That data would fit in an the size of NFT commitment. So sellers could announce that they were having an auction, [if/when we had a CashToken powered social dapp for that.](https://fundme.cash/campaign/28)

***

EDIT:

The auction contract requires that each output pay for a lot on a corresponding input, so many lots (of the same age) could be purchased simultaneously in a single transaction. An app could include a function to close the auction by buying every lot in a single transaction."

Bond Market Blues,0,1k6ky0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k6ky0o/bond_market_blues/,1,2025-04-24 00:53:33,"I. The Starting Point: Cracks in the Old System

We‚Äôre already here.
	‚Ä¢	Sovereign debt is unpayable: U.S., Japan, EU, China‚Äîall buried in debt with no path to repayment.
	‚Ä¢	Central banks are trapped: Raise rates? Trigger defaults. Cut rates? Fuel inflation.
	‚Ä¢	Trust is eroding: Bond yields rise, currencies wobble, and capital starts fleeing ‚Äúsafe‚Äù assets.

Key stress point: The bond market begins to smell smoke. Foreign buyers (like China or Japan) stop buying Treasuries. The Fed quietly becomes the buyer of last resort again.

‚∏ª

II. The Liquidity Trap Meets Fiscal Dominance
	‚Ä¢	Rates rise, and the cost of debt explodes. U.S. interest payments hit $1.5 trillion/year.
	‚Ä¢	Treasury auctions begin to fail. Investors demand higher yields to roll debt.
	‚Ä¢	The Fed is forced into stealth yield curve control‚Äîbuying longer-term debt to suppress rates.

This is the moment the mask slips.
Markets realize: the Fed is no longer targeting inflation. It‚Äôs targeting solvency.

‚∏ª

III. Inflation Reignites, Faith Breaks
	‚Ä¢	Suppressed yields and unchecked spending light a second wave of inflation.
	‚Ä¢	Savers are slaughtered by negative real rates.
	‚Ä¢	Financial repression begins: capital controls, mandatory bond purchases, limits on cash or crypto use.

But capital is fluid, and trust is faster than law. Money leaks out‚Äîinto gold, hard assets, offshore accounts‚Äîand increasingly, Bitcoin.

‚∏ª

IV. The Flippening (of Trust)

This is not a technological shift. It‚Äôs a trust migration.
	‚Ä¢	Nation-states lose the narrative. ‚ÄúRisk-free‚Äù becomes a joke.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin is no longer seen as speculative‚Äîit‚Äôs seen as a hedge against sovereign failure.
	‚Ä¢	Nations with weak currencies begin to adopt Bitcoin openly (already happening with El Salvador).
	‚Ä¢	Corporates start holding it on balance sheets‚Äînot to get rich, but to survive devaluation.

Some early governments fight it‚Äîbanning self-custody, labeling it dangerous, taxing it to death. Others embrace it‚Äîgaining early access to the next financial layer.

‚∏ª

V. The New Market Infrastructure Emerges

As trust deepens:
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin lending markets mature: Lenders issue loans backed by overcollateralized BTC.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin-denominated bonds are issued‚Äîeither directly (El Salvador-style), or via DeFi protocols.
	‚Ä¢	Sovereigns who can‚Äôt borrow in fiat anymore start to float Bitcoin-backed debt‚Äîjust to get access to real capital.
	‚Ä¢	Layer 2 systems (Lightning, Fedimint, Ark, etc.) enable payment rails and banking functions.

A new monetary ecosystem grows‚Äîparallel to the old one‚Äîbut faster, smaller, and harder.

‚∏ª

VI. The Collapse Phase of the Old Guard

Eventually, the debt burden breaks the fiat system:
	‚Ä¢	Central banks lose control of inflation and can no longer contain bond yields.
	‚Ä¢	A default or restructuring hits a major economy (Japan? Italy? U.S.?)
	‚Ä¢	The dollar survives‚Äîbut not as king. A multi-polar system forms: USD, CNY, and BTC.

In this world:
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin is the reserve of last resort.
	‚Ä¢	Fiat is still used, but it‚Äôs anchored, not absolute.
	‚Ä¢	Credit exists, but it‚Äôs hard-won, expensive, and honest.

‚∏ª

VII. Life After the Transition: Scarcity Reinstated
	‚Ä¢	Governments shrink. They can no longer print to fund endless wars, bloated bureaucracies, or financial bailouts.
	‚Ä¢	Savings are meaningful. Time preference drops. Capital investment improves.
	‚Ä¢	Credit is available, but collateralized and market-priced.
	‚Ä¢	The financial system becomes more stable, but less forgiving.

And Bitcoin?
It isn‚Äôt a replacement for government. It‚Äôs a neutral monetary foundation‚Äîlike gravity. Everyone must build on top of it honestly, or fail.

‚∏ª

Final Image:

Picture a future where:
	‚Ä¢	Treasury bonds are relics.
	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin yields set the global floor for risk-free return.
	‚Ä¢	Countries are rated by how credibly they can borrow real money.
	‚Ä¢	And the market, not the central bank, holds the true power."

I decided to try out one of the ideas he mentioned. Didn't expect much, just did it out of curiosity. And strangely enough, it actually had an effect. After that, I started looking at a few things differently ‚Äî things I had previously ignored.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1h0nwvh/btcers_owning_coins_proportion_of_selfcustody_vs/

The numbers who hold their own keys / coins self-custodially is strictly larger than the number of people who run nodes.

Why is that?

Because you can hold your keys/coins without even running a node. You can use a light wallet (SPV), or even just hold your own bitcoin on a paper wallet (written record of the key / seed phrase).

So there are even fewer than 15% who run their own nodes. Likely way fewer.

Just bear this in mind when you hear BTC people talk about how everyone should be running their own node etc.

That's bunk, and has almost always been bunk. Satoshi didn't design the system in a way that requires everyone to their own node. The BTC crowd doesn't do this either. The people claiming you need to, belong to a very small part of the user group.

Where things can get off track is when you let the proclaimed needs of a very small minority dictate the properties of the system that is supposed to be usable by all its users. The best check on preventing the majority being exploited by the minority, is for the majority to check, frequently, whether the system still performs well for their purposes.

Theoretically, if it was currency, this would be happening daily, en masse."

"Western BCH Withdrawals, Eastern Exchange BCH Deposits: What's Happening? Self-Custody Gains Traction, Binance Attracts Leveraged Whales.",11,1k2gagc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k2gagc/western_bch_withdrawals_eastern_exchange_bch/,1,2025-04-18 16:34:20,"Recent trends in the cryptocurrency market reveal intriguing shifts in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) activity. Over the past two years, data suggests a growing inclination among users on Western exchanges like Coinbase to withdraw their BCH holdings, likely indicating a move towards self-custody. This observation aligns with a significant surge in hardware wallet purchases across various brands, further supporting the notion of users prioritizing direct control over their digital assets. Bitcoin Cash, known for its fast and low-cost transactions, facilitates this self-custody trend seamlessly.

Concurrently, a contrasting pattern has emerged on platforms such as Binance. Unlike previous behavior where traders primarily used Bitcoin (BTC) or Tether (USDT) as collateral for BCH leveraged futures, substantial BCH deposits, reaching into the hundreds of thousands, have been observed. This novel trend suggests that large-scale leverage traders, often referred to as ""whales,"" are now utilizing BCH itself to back their positions.

This shift could potentially be linked to the recent endeavors by major exchanges like OKX and Binance to expand their services into the United States. As these platforms navigate regulatory landscapes, they may be prompting users to transition away from naked trading positions and instead deposit actual cryptocurrency to collateralize their trades. This would explain the observed increase in BCH deposits on Binance, representing a move towards more in kind crypto backed positions.

Edit:

Further anecdotal evidence highlights this divergence. On April 12th and 14th, the price of BCH on the spot exchange Coinbase briefly surpassed $380. In stark contrast, Binance, a platform offering leveraged trading, saw BCH peak at only $358 on the 12th. This discrepancy potentially arises from the fundamental differences between spot and leverage exchanges. Coinbase, as a spot market, requires actual BCH to facilitate trades, limiting downward price pressure if supply is constrained. Conversely, Binance allows traders to short-sell significant amounts of BCH without holding the underlying asset, potentially creating abundant, albeit synthetic, liquidity that can suppress price, even if the exchange's actual BCH reserves are limited."

However, I noticed that BCH is regaining it's upward momentum so it's time to bring these play dollars back home again to the best blockchain in the world. BCH.

I ironically started here, in 2017. It was the first crypto I bought, at the pico top of 4000$ when it came onto Coinbase. Here I began my journey into decentralization, learned about the truth of the money system, got introduced to the coolest most based community in crypto - and here I vowed no matter where I played I would always return value back into BCH.

Now is the time, my shift back will be epic. From different chains. From my job, spare dollars. 

I'm not a BCH maxi, but I will hold a significant portion of my wealth in BCH.

From everywhere it will slowly trickle back into BCH.

And then I will simply wait. 

For the inevitable proof that peer to peer cash will outdo everything else.

Hey everyone,

I don‚Äôt normally do this, and it‚Äôs honestly hard to even type this out‚Äîbut I‚Äôm in a really rough spot right now. Life‚Äôs thrown me more curveballs than I can handle lately, and I‚Äôm just trying to keep my head above water.

I've been doing everything I can to stay strong, to keep pushing, to not let it break me‚Ä¶ but right now I‚Äôm drained‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and financially. I‚Äôm not looking for pity or handouts. Just some support. Even a kind word goes a long way right now. But if anyone is in a position to help, even just a little, it would mean the world to me.

This isn't easy to admit, but I believe in community, and I believe that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to reach out when you need a hand.

Thanks for reading. Seriously.

üö® [WARNING] MEXC Froze Stolen ETH‚Ä¶ Then Refused to Return It ‚Äî Even After Police & Court Order,6,1k1xwg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k1xwg1/warning_mexc_froze_stolen_eth_then_refused_to/,7,2025-04-18 01:02:22,"I'm sharing this to raise awareness about a serious issue involving MEXC Exchange, stolen ETH, and a shocking refusal to cooperate ‚Äî even after receiving a court order and police involvement.

üß† TL;DR
20.44 ETH was stolen in a targeted hack. Funds were traced through Ethereum & ArbitrumFinal destination: a wallet on MEXC Exchange. MEXC confirmed the ETH arrived & froze the account. Slovenian police submitted a legal return request through MEXC's official LEROS portal. MEXC received an officially translated court order. Still REFUSED to return the ETH. 
Let that sink in: even when the crime is proven and the courts are involved, the stolen funds stay locked ‚Äî but not returned.

üîç The Trace
Using public on-chain data:
5 ETH withdrawals from Bitstamp (totaling 20.44 ETH)Passed through mixers and multiple wallets. Bridged from Ethereum ‚Üí Arbitrum using Stargate. Final deposit: ~4.7 ETH lands in MEXC wallet 0x9b64...77E5You can literally follow it step-by-step on Etherscan and Arbiscan. The evidence is bulletproof.

ü§î Why This Should Worry You
MEXC is an offshore exchange (Seychelles-based), so it's outside the reach of many global consumer protection laws. But here‚Äôs the kicker:
""We‚Äôll freeze a criminal‚Äôs account‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôll keep the stolen funds.""If that becomes the norm, no wallet is safe. The question is no longer whether exchanges can trace and block stolen crypto ‚Äî it‚Äôs whether they‚Äôll ever give it back.

üì¢ Why We Need to Talk About This
This isn‚Äôt just about one user or one case. It‚Äôs about:
Holding centralized exchanges accountableProtecting users from becoming victims of regulatory loopholesDemanding that platforms honor legal systems, not just freeze funds and walk awayIf one of the world‚Äôs biggest exchanges can ignore police channels and court orders, what hope is there for the average crypto investor?

üëä Let‚Äôs Take Action
Avoid MEXC until they release a transparent stolen asset policySpread the word ‚Äî Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, DiscordTag @MEXC_Official and demand accountabilitySupport crypto journalism that exposes bad actorsShare your own stories ‚Äî let‚Äôs make noiseWe‚Äôve seen great things happen when this community pulls together. Let‚Äôs not allow this to be swept under the rug.
Stay safe out there. üîê

I sent my BTC to my Nexo BTC wallet address and did not receive the funds.

  
I was told they had changed my BTC wallet address and it is no longer an active address and they cannot retrieve my BTC.

  
I checked yesterday and there are multiple transactions in that wallet.

  
I know this has happened to multiple people and Nexo refuse to return the crypto.

  
However you can see the wallet is very much active and still is, so they lied.

  
Any ideas to get my BTC back, it was a fair amount to lose (for me anyway).

Let's talk about block time for 1001st time,23,1jzomlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jzomlh/lets_talk_about_block_time_for_1001st_time/,44,2025-04-15 05:39:35,"I believe we can safely have 1-minute block time WITHOUT sacrificing anything in scalability / decentralization - because tech has advanced so much since 2009. Even worst-case orphan rate would be under 2% (case of full block download), and thanks to compact blocks typical rates would be in 0.2%-0.6% range ([full analysis](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md#mining-centralization)).

Not only that, but we can do a [little refactoring](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md#blockchain-height-abstraction) so it would be easy to later change to 30s when tech further advances - we could make target block time just 1 parameter like blocksize limit, with everything auto-adjusting around it (DAA, emission, ABLA, locktime, etc.)

### What about emission?

Of course everything stays the same, before: 3.25 BCH x 1 block every 10 minutes, after: 0.325 BCH x 10 every 10 minutes.
Due to integer rounding there'd be [slightly less BCH minted in total](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md?ref_type=heads#block-subsidy-shortfall): 20,999,999.7270 instead of 20,999,999.9769.

### What would this change mean for UX?

- 1-conf: now 1-in-4 TXs will wait 14 min. or more, and 1-in-20 will wait 30 min. or more; with 1-min target the variance band is reduced to 1-3 min. I even made a little game where you can test your confirmation luck ([link](https://fablous-18ff29.gitlab.io/)) and get a feel for the difference.
- N-conf: now a 60min target wait (6x10) will exceed 80 min. 1-in-5 times. With faster blocks a 60min target wait (60x1) would get more reliably closer to 60min, with only 0.86% chance of exceeding 80min

### What about 0-conf?

It's great, we continue to use it. This [will make on-boarding easier](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md?ref_type=heads#potential-0-conf-adoption-benefits) as it will shorten the uncertainty window, and there are cases where 0-conf must fall back to 1-conf which would benefit from this (like when moving from 0-conf defi to 0-conf merchant payments - the p2sh unconfirmed ancestors create risks here)

### What about header chain overheads?

- Nodes will always need whole header chain, and it will grow at ~42MB/year, trivial at current state of tech
- Light clients need those for verifying SPV proofs but thankfully there's [a way to compact that data for light clients](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md#spv-client-storage-requirements)

### What about locktime?

This was one of my concerns too, turns out this is the [easiest technical challenge to solve](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md?ref_type=heads#transaction-locktime-and-input-sequence).

**There is no technical obstacle to having 1-minute block time. The only question is: do we want it?**

###  But Bitcoin always had 10-minute time, will we still be Bitcoin?

Of course we will. Ask yourself, what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin?

From the WP:

>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

The 10-minute time was a number Satoshi picked and didn't think too much about, I found that his concerns were only of practical nature. I discuss that head-on in the CHIP's Intro:

In Bitcoin whitepaper ([Section 7. Reclaiming Disk Space](https://github.com/ibz/bitcoin-whitepaper-markdown/blob/master/bitcoin-whitepaper.md#7-reclaiming-disk-space)), it was only mentioned once, when discussing node memory requirements:

>A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

When paper was first revealed on Cryptography Mailing List, it was also mentioned only once, alongside with explanation of Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA):

>> Further, your description of events implies restrictions
>> on timing and coin generation - that the entire network
>> generates coins slowly compared to the time required for
>> news of a new coin to flood the network
>
>Sorry if I didn't make that clear. The target time between blocks will probably be 10 minutes.
>
>Every block includes its creation time. If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it. If the timespan over the last 6*24*30 blocks is less than 15 days, blocks are being generated too fast and the proof-of-work difficulty doubles. Everyone does the same calculation with the same chain data, so they all get the same result at the same link in the chain.

Only later, in [e-mail exchange with Mike Hearn](https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/emails/mike-hearn/9/#selection-25.3372-25.4009), did Satoshi give a hint about reasoning, to describe what we now call orphan races and selfish mining:

>>Another is the 10 minute block target. I understand this was chosen to
>>allow transactions to propagate through the network. However existing
>>large P2P networks like BGP can propagate new data worldwide in <1
>>minute.
>
>If propagation is 1 minute, then 10 minutes was a good guess.  Then nodes are only losing 10% of their work (1 minute/10 minutes).  If the CPU time wasted by latency was a more significant share, there may be weaknesses I haven't thought of.  An attacker would not be affected by latency, since he's chaining his own blocks, so he would have an advantage.  The chain would temporarily fork more often due to latency.

Since then, technology has progressed immensely and a thriving industry of Bitcoin competitors (""altcoins"", near-universally preferring lower block times) has emerged demonstrating viability of shorter block times.
Bitcoin Cash can now follow suit, leveraging today's tech to rethink that 10-minute legacy.

We will lean on the same reasoning as Satoshi's, and use a more conservative orphan rate threshold (2%), to show that Bitcoin Cash can safely upgrade to 1-minute target block time and reap 10x improvement in confirmation speed."

Satoshi stared out the window, his reflection fractured by raindrops. Beside him, Eva slept fitfully, one hand resting over her stomach, dark circles under her eyes betraying sleepless nights of shared anguish.

A commotion erupted several seats ahead. Two teenage boys argued with the ticket checker, their voices rising in desperation.

""Please, sir, we just need to get to Palo Alto‚Äî""

""No ticket, no ride,"" the checker interrupted, his voice firm but weary. ""Rules are rules.""

Satoshi watched as the boys were escorted off at the next station, their figures growing smaller through the rain-streaked window. The train lurched forward again, each car following the one before it in an unbroken chain.

Chain.

The word lodged in his mind as he stared at the coupling mechanism between the cars. Each car validated the one behind it, connected in an unbreakable sequence. His heart began to race. With trembling hands, he pulled a napkin from his pocket, his pen scratching out rough diagrams. Blocks. Each one linked to the previous one. A chain of digital truth that couldn't be broken.

This ideological consistency could appeal to a niche group of users and investors who prioritize PoW's perceived security and decentralization characteristics over alternatives like Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

 * Merged Mining Potential: The shared SHA-256 algorithm allows for merged mining. This means Bitcoin miners could potentially mine iceEVcoin simultaneously without significant additional hardware or energy costs, earning supplementary income (especially relevant as Bitcoin's own block subsidies decrease over time). For iceEVcoin, this offers a path to leverage Bitcoin's established network security.

 * Extreme Scarcity Appeal: The proposed 7 million supply cap represents extreme digital scarcity, even more so than Bitcoin. This could attract a niche market segment that specifically values absolute rarity as a primary characteristic of a store-of-value asset.

 * Reinforcing the PoW Narrative: In the ongoing debate between PoW and PoS, the existence of a secondary, Bitcoin-aligned PoW chain like iceEVcoin could serve to highlight PoW's perceived advantages (like permissionless participation). It adds to the diversity of the PoW ecosystem, potentially showcasing its resilience and reinforcing the narrative against PoS alternatives, which might be viewed with more suspicion regarding centralization or state influence in a Bitcoin-centric future.

 * Anti-Centralization Narrative: While the feasibility was questioned in the reports, the proposed mobile EV mining concept taps into concerns about mining centralization. This narrative, focused on distributing hash power, could appeal to users specifically concerned about potential government influence over large, stationary mining operations.

Bitcoin is moss.,22,1jy05hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jy05hf/bitcoin_is_moss/,20,2025-04-13 00:06:10,"Bitcoin Is Moss

Body:
Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a revolution in the traditional sense. It doesn‚Äôt shout. It doesn‚Äôt demand. It doesn‚Äôt storm the gates.

It spreads.

Like moss.

It moves quietly. It doesn‚Äôt need headlines or permission. It simply finds surfaces‚Äîold stone, decaying wood, forgotten cracks in foundations‚Äîand begins to grow. Slowly. Persistently. Irreversibly.

Fiat systems are the stone.
They appear solid: institutions, currencies, central banks. But over time, they weather. They crack. Their weight becomes their weakness. And once those cracks appear, Bitcoin enters.

It doesn‚Äôt attack the structure. It covers it. It renders it obsolete not by confrontation, but by quiet redundancy. It‚Äôs not about destruction. It‚Äôs about persistence.

You can‚Äôt uproot moss‚Äîit has no central stalk.
You can‚Äôt kill it by cutting‚Äîit grows from fragments.
You can‚Äôt burn it away‚Äîit thrives in the shade and returns with the rain.

Bitcoin is the same.
There‚Äôs no CEO to arrest.
No headquarters to raid.
No switch to flip.
It‚Äôs a distributed organism. A living network of memory and value.
Every attempt to contain it only spreads its awareness.

And like moss, it thrives in neglected places‚Äîwhere trust has eroded, where inflation eats value, where systems are collapsing under their own weight.

The more centralized control tries to reassert itself, the more obvious the need for something else becomes.
Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt replace fiat by force. It makes it irrelevant.
Not through revolution, but through saturation.

You don‚Äôt notice moss at first.
Then one day, the statue is covered.
The wall is green.
The monument to the old world is now a part of the forest floor.

That‚Äôs Bitcoin.

Not a war.
A reclamation.

Why 30-min block time is better than 10-min block time,0,1jyhl89,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jyhl89/why_30min_block_time_is_better_than_10min_block/,24,2025-04-13 15:45:30,"If you understand how PoW works, you know why SN decided that block time is 10 mins and not 5 mins. When we have too many miners that speed up the bitcoin clock, difficulty adjustment slows it down so the nodes can have consensus. The slower the block time, the less likely the event that 2 valid blocks are found at the same time where we have to measure the chain tip weight to decide the winning chain tip. The losing chain tip wastes a lot of energy.

""The payee needs proof that at the time of each trans¬≠ac¬≠tion, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. [‚Ä¶] When there are multiple double-spent versions of the same trans¬≠ac¬≠tion, one and only one will become valid. The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that it‚Äôs valid. The network will resolve any possible double-spend races by then."" - SN (2009)

Based on the SN's quote above, we should have decided that the block time is 1 hour. However, that might be too slow for some applications, so 30 mins seem better.

I have proposed a slower version of Bitcoin, its whitepaper can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iceEVcoin/s/DXsdJbBEV0

How BTC will be inflated on L2s and bailouts will continue even on Bitcoin standard.,25,1jx9uhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jx9uhy/how_btc_will_be_inflated_on_l2s_and_bailouts_will/,21,2025-04-12 00:11:57,"I'll tell you how inflation and bailouts will eventually happen even on a bitcoin standard.

It'll start with tx fees gng through the roof as banks, govts and big businesses start settling onchain.
All normies will have to deposit their btc in the banks, as all small utxo  (ie. 99% of population's stash) will become dust utxo, and self custody on L1 will become a luxury only top 0.0001% could afford. 

All normies now transact on L2's where banks provide their IoU's. Initially banks will happily provide proof of reserves to lure you in and make you trust them, but eventually they'll stop doing so, as they start inflating the IoU's.
At one point, the IoU's floating around will be too much and ppl will start questioning the banks, but even then what could one do, since you can't self custody on L1 due to high tx fees.

Even if ppl start withdrawing from banks somehow, the banks will stop  withdrawals pretty quickly and central banks / govts instead of taking action on the banks for inflating the IoU's, will simply make fractional reserve legal for BTC too.
So now for each 1 BTC, banks would be allowed to issue 10 BTC IoU's on L2, that too legally (which they would already be doing for a long time, and even after getting caught it will just become a legal practice instead)

Welcome back to Gold 2.0 system, where Fiat was the L2 for gold, and we all know how. that turned out.

But somehow ppl continue to believe there'll be no bailouts, censorship, draconian level surveillance and taxation on L2. 

Only real solution is some p2p cash with low fee L1 tx's with relatively quick tx confirmations. 

BCH works great as a p2p ecash system on L1, but its limited supply and trending to zero block subsidy is a major risk, as it puts a time limit on the adoption picking up. 
If the adoption / tx volume doesn't pick before the block subsidy runs out, BCH will be dead too. 

I think some pre-determined linear inflation is a good thing in the long term, as it replaces lost coins and more importantly prevents hoarding mentality. 
It also doesn't put a hard time limit on the adoption, which will clearly take a long time, given how brainwashed general public is about BTC. "

Saylor was wrong. 2nd best is here.,0,1jxwxiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jxwxiq/saylor_was_wrong_2nd_best_is_here/,56,2025-04-12 20:50:54,"Historically, among the metallic money group, Silver is the 2nd best compared to Gold. Some people simply prefer Silver's color.

Among the blockchain money group, the 2nd best is really similar to Bitcoin, except it has slower block time (30 mins), and lower supply cap (7 million coins). All other parameters remain the same as Bitcoin.

Since PoW consumes a lot of energy but most people only use it as store of value, it is more logical to slow the block time down to 30 mins (vs Bitcoin's 10 mins). You don't put your Gold into storage and immediately take your Gold out 10 mins later. Even when you charge your electric cars, it will take at least 30 mins to get any meaningful energy.

The lower supply cap is obviously to minimalize the ""inflation"" caused by this inevitable hard fork.

The whitepaper of this hard fork was shared to r/btc yesterday. I also shared it to r/Bitcoin today, as I needed time to find the right words to share it there, where a lot of Bitcoin maxis are. Still, the moderators there did not allow this to be posted.

Please don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin and Bitcoin is still the best. However, this ""2nd best"" is inevitable, since careless people are everywhere and most lost coins cannot be easily recovered. As the number of lost coins rises, at some point we might not have enough coins to address the salability across scales.

Lastly, I want to note that this is still just a whitepaper written by my friend Frost Aiken (a developer who prefers to remain pseudonymous). I am having trouble contacting Frost but will try again later. When and how this whitepaper can become an actual hard fork will depend on many factors and only time will tell. God bless and a good weekend y'all.

So back in June last year, I began buying Bitcoin in portions, gradually building up to a total of 5 BTC by the end of November‚Äîwhen the price was around $37,000. I held on, trusting my read of the global situation, and when Bitcoin hit $100,000, I sold everything.

This was actually my first real experience with this kind of investment‚Äîand it paid off big time.

Not trusting themselves to understand it, they ignore it, believe what existing financial authorities tell them about it (often a rather biased story since 2009) and rather play the lottery (stonks, ponzi ""coins"" ... incl. BTC these days).

It's a shame. It really seems people need a shock (or a hugely visible, like nation level, example of how peer to peer cash adoption can succeed).

I don't think any form of speculation is the ""killer app"" for bringing Bitcoin awareness to the masses.

It's mildly encouraging that a lot of people now recognize the threat of inflation and the difficulty of saving for old age, and some of them may re-examine what is wrong with our financial systems and whether it's a problem inherent in the facile money printing of fiat (debt money)."
"Whitepaper: iceEVcoin - Proposal for Minimalist Bitcoin Variant (7M Cap, 30m PoW Blocks) - Seeking Developer Feedback & Collaboration",0,1jwm4yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jwm4yd/whitepaper_iceevcoin_proposal_for_minimalist/,4,2025-04-11 04:56:58,"Hello r/btc community,

I'm Bubbly_Ice3836. I'm sharing a whitepaper today written by 'Frost Aiken', a developer who prefers to remain pseudonymous.

This paper outlines iceEVcoin, conceived as an experimental, minimalist variant of the Bitcoin protocol. It stems from a deep respect for Bitcoin's core principles (Proof-of-Work, UTXO model) but explores the potential impact of just two specific parameter changes:

 * Maximum Supply: Fixed at 7 million coins (exploring extreme scarcity).

 * Target Block Interval: Set to 30 minutes (exploring potential effects on network energy profile and niche settlement times, like EV charging).

The full rationale and technical specification details are in the whitepaper linked below. The intention is strict adherence to Bitcoin's design in all other functional aspects.

Whitepaper is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iceEVcoin/s/DimWJTLigi

Current Status & Call for Collaboration:

To be fully transparent: The source code implementing these changes is not yet developed. Frost Aiken conceptualized the variant and authored the paper, but due to resource constraints, implementation hasn't begun.

This whitepaper is being shared specifically to gauge interest within communities familiar with Bitcoin forks/variants and to seek potential C++ developers knowledgeable about the Bitcoin Core codebase who might find this specific exploration intriguing and be interested in collaborating on its implementation (code, testnet, etc.).

Acknowledged Trade-offs:
The 30-minute block time is a major design choice with a significant impact on transaction speed, making it unsuitable for many applications. This is understood and is part of the specific trade-off being explored, as detailed in the paper.

Project Ethos:
There is no pre-mine, ICO, or founder's reward envisioned. The intent is a fair launch mirroring Bitcoin's principles, should the project proceed to implementation.

Contact:
Developers interested in discussing the technical aspects further or potentially collaborating can reach out to me (Bubbly_Ice3836) via Reddit PM initially. We welcome constructive technical feedback and discussion on the merits and challenges of this proposed variant."

But this has blinded me from looking at what bitcoin could be if it didn't have these issues, and I do see that a decentralized, hard capped, and easily transportable asset might have value. I do not know if you can ever get this without it developing into what bitcoin has become though. It could be that bitcoin's path was inevitable.

I understand the potential economic benefit of growing the market for Bitcoin; but the other benefits of crypto, like the privacy/security aspect, would seem to be much more at risk when a government tries to assert influence - one with quantum computers that can both mine coins and crack codes better than any other user in existence. 

My one friend who hold a fair amount of crypto thinks it's a good thing, but as someone who first learned about BTC around its security and anonymity value, it would seem that for some people, it would be less valuable if the Federal Government had its own Bitcoin mining and administrative tools and oversight influence.  What say you? "

vox.cash - A collection of integrated Bitcoin Cash mini apps. | fundme.cash campaign #28:,11,1jtnkck,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jtnkck/voxcash_a_collection_of_integrated_bitcoin_cash/,0,2025-04-07 10:09:12,"Yesterday I started a fundme for a collection of small BCH web apps in an integrated wallet. Collectively, the hope is, if a number of ""safe"" ideas are integrated into a wallet and handed to a novice user, they might have **more** bitcoin (cash) the next time you meet up. These ""apps"" could live in a walled garden and eventually graduate out to other wallets.

Having several small apps integrated into one can often be more than the sum of the parts. There's a lot of things that can be done by utilizing small functions together that can't be done with isolated apps.

These are the mini apps:

- Chat(s)
- An index database
- Subscriptions
- Fungible Token Mining
- Limit Order Dexes
- Auctions
- Time locks (re: Hodl & Last Will)
- Yield(s) (FBCH & Badgers)
- Irrevocable trusts (re:unspent.cash)
- Integrated Accounting

The end product will be deployed in a unified platform with integrated web wallet. This app is going to be like a refresh of member or memo with CashTokens, but without the need for a custom indexer or specialized ""backend"" server. There's going to be less emphasis on the social media aspect and more focus on basic economic access and utility.

All of the ""mini-apps"" listed below will be small on-chain contracts. Some ideas are completely new and some are updated versions of earlier projects. It may seem like a lot of work, but the smaller the contract the easier things are to build, audit, and debug. 

This app will be funded through a [fundme.cash campaign #28, which and expires in July.](https://fundme.cash/)

This work is expected take about a year to build out. Most of the contracts are near completion and through testing. There is a budget of about 20 BCH for audits. 

**There are people in the world who want to take everyone's Bitcoin Cash to get rid of it as a currency. These people REALLY DO NOT IT LIKE when people save BCH‚Äïespecially with defi contracts. There's been threats, harassment and ultimatums with this work, including by some people claiming to further the original bitcoin p2p project.**

**Please consider utilizing the pseudonymous properties of Bitcoin Cash if making a donation to avoid a DM from those folks.** 

For developers and bot programmers, most of these utilities will also ship as stateless libauth template ""mixin"" functions for any web wallet, meaning app developers can adopt a single component, or follow along with their idea on the same template and mainnet-js. The core functionality will also be an open software software library and command line utility, if someone wants to automate or integrate some component into their project or workflow.

Who am I? I develop software under the username github/gitlab account 2qx. I was a founding developer on mainnet-js; mainnet was originally suppose to have a [number of verbs](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810183217/https://mainnet.cash/2020-07-31) to closely integrate with BCH defi in 2020. In December 2022, I raised 60 BCH to further develop unspent.app, which was about six mini-app contracts (without a wallet or tokens). In 2023, unspent was reduced into just perpetuities as unspent.cash. In 2024, I raised 60 BCH to build futurebitcoin.cash, a recursive time-locking market using fungible CashToken series.

## 0. We need to have a chat. 

Right now, the places where the original idea of bitcoin can be freely discussed are in a fairly precarious state. 

One of the main platforms has recently announced a ban on the use of any cryptocurrency (except their preferred currencies), and it's based in a jurisdiction that is hostile to free thought and free speech. 

Another (older) platform is a now a publicly traded company with a bot problem. And being based in the United States, it too is now in a jurisdiction increasingly hostile to free speech and thought. 

And finally, there is the platform where bot engagement trolled a dull eccentric individual into bidding for the platform before he realized much of the engagement he was basing his decision on was driven by trolls and bots. It no longer seems like an app where many smart folks disseminate ideas. 

In short, we need a public group chat that's not vicariously controlled by a Russian actor, and where the ability to talk about and use the real bitcoin can never be rugged. So we're going to have a [public group chat on-chain](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/futurechan-a-message-board-contract/1541), utilizing NFT commitments as the storage medium. Messages will cost about 250 sats per byte, and old messages will get burned up to feed a future saving economy. 

With this chan, any message can be censored by anyone for 2500 sats per byte, and it will be possible to see which messages got burned early for those interested. Different channels for different topics will be supported. 

This app is a marketplace of ideas.

## 1. A reliable key-value database.

Similar to a group chat, just storing a little bit of data announcing the existence of a defi contract can be a significant pain point for many new small dapp projects. 

Currently, many dapps have built custom crawlers to index data stored on-chain using what are called ""op_return"" messages. Many apps are relying on public instances of [chaingraph](https://chaingraph.cash/), which is software that is expensive and non-trivial to run. There are also performance and scaling issues that arise with these indexers which often hampers the user experience in dapps.

So the second mini-app will be a highly distributed key-value database. [Small index](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/a-small-key-value-index-contract/1471) is a contract that will be able to store references and records to chat groups, auctions, trade offers and new long-running contracts. Data can be read from the highly reliable and scalable SPV index (fulcrum, electrumX or rostrum). Reading the records for a key will be as reliable as looking up the token balance of an address.

Records will be limited to 40-bytes (or the current NFT commitment length) and cost 1 sat per block to store. Miners will collect storage fees to clean up old data. 

This app is a market for data storage.

## 2. Subscriptions

Regardless of whether the fund.me campaign is successful, looking forward, it will be better for the ecosystem to have a more predictable funding model available. 

So there will be an ugly ""subscribe"" button in the app, that does nothing but hide the button for people that subscribed. 

The [subscription contract](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/unspent-phi-v3-timelocking-token-aware-contracts/1501#subscriptions-share-vesting-revocable-token-annuities-3) will allow anyone to create subscriptions paid out in any fungible token. Users will be able to cancel or withdraw their subscription balance early with an NFT baton held in their wallet. 

The subscriptions will be announced using the key-value small database from the previous step. Miners (or any enterprising party), will be able to collect a few sats for executing the regular installments. 

Easily creating subscriptions for content creators, app developers, podcasters and mods will be available in the mini-app. The app should enable predictable baseline revenue for many voices and creators across the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

**There will be no tiers or rent-seeking features for this specific project. Although other people may build apps utilizing gated subscription features, there's too much to do and too little time to try to milk people over sats, so, for this app, the subscription will only ever just hide an ugly subscribe button.**

This app will create a market mechanism for future support.

## 3. Mining

Novice users want to mine. So we're going to let them mine fungible tokens that can then be traded for sats. 

Bitcoin Cash previously had a minable SLP token called [Mistcoin](web.archive.org/web/20210128134553/https://mistcoin.org/), which was a project that saw immediate spontaneous adoption and a healthy secondary market. Additionally, an early iteration of Unspent Phi had a minable contract paying sats, which saw immediate uptake. 

So we're going to have a multi-threaded contract paying out tokens according to some half-life with an adjustable difficulty target stored in mutable NFT commitment‚Äïbecause we effing can. 

Eventually, if it gets big enough, the average of the difficulty targets across the mining threads can be utilized as a proxy for a [highly decentralized price oracle](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/research-block-difficulty-as-a-price-oracle/1426). That price oracle can then be utilized by other contracts to drive more stable coin markets. 

This app is a market to trade energy for tokens.

## 4. A Dex fit for a stablecoin

Users want stability. And the detractors of the idea of bitcoin often cite volatility (relative to fiat) as the first major risk to deter adoption among novice users. 

While automated market algorithms can provide liquidity across a very robust price range, we need markets to trade stable assets with a fair amount of depth at very specific prices as well. 

We need limit order markets. By storing limit order data in the commitment of an NFT, it will be possible for anyone to list tokens for sale on a contract, and then have [the contract allow](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/catdex-a-token-category-authorized-decentralized-exchange/1480) anyone to trade at the pre-defined order price. 

This app is similar to open ask limit orders on memo or tapswap, but it will allow partial orders and be bidirectional. 

Someone could fund a contract with sats to buy a token at a predefined price, and/or sell the same token at a higher price from using the same contract. 

Many users will be able to list their spreads for a particular token, and bots will be able to arbitrage across many contracts and dexes. Catdex has no commissions.

This is a market for a stable coin.

## 5. Dutch auctions for token price discovery. 

If someone sells a bunch of tokens, often the only record or price history is the initial token sale. Without active and liquid markets, there is no data to dissuade the ""investor"" that they're actually just throwing their money away on collectibles. Without liquid markets, collectibles can absorb liquidity, attention and mind-share, often without much merit or underlying utility to give value back to the user. 

On other chains, the value of NFT sets can eventually be estimated by records of on-chain English auctions. But auctions could also be very efficiently held on Bitcoin Cash for any type of token by using the age of the unspent output in [a Dutch auction](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/unspent-phi-v3-timelocking-token-aware-contracts/1501/3). 

The auction app will allow anyone to announce a dutch auction, and fund their contract with any number of fungible tokens (or NFTs) to be disposed of on their behalf. Anyone will be able to clearly see the current price given the starting price and the age of the unspent output. Anyone will be able to purchase the tokens in a transaction paying the consignor the current ask. Bots and traders will be able to arbitrage or trade tokens at auction with the same token listed as a limit order (or AMM threads). 

Users may cancel their lots by buying back their own tokens. Bidders can be fairly assured that lots will sell to someone. And the process of price discovery can be a reference to speculators of collectibles. Auctions will have no listing commissions or buyers premiums‚Äïonly fees paid to miners. 

This is a market to liquidate tokens.

## 6 & 7, Absolute and relative time locks. 

Hodl-style and rolling time locks have been around for ten years. 

We've had these apps in the Electrum Cash as plugins. Users can lock coins until a certain time, or have their coins pay out to another party if not touched for some period of time. 

These ideas [will be refreshed](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/unspent-phi-v3-timelocking-token-aware-contracts/1501#absolute-timelock-bip65-hodl-style-vault-with-cashtoken-support-1) to handle locking CashTokens as well. 

Both of the contracts can be made to ""auto-complete"" via anyone-can-spend transactions, by announcing a record of the lock using the small key-store database (#1 above). 

These contracts market the idea of locking coins.

## 8 & 9, Users want reliable yields.

We have two dapps on Bitcoin Cash paying a solid yield without risking user capital on highly-manipulated markets.  

Users can stake coins for [Badgers](https://badgers.cash); or they can take coupons for staking [Futures](https://futurebitcoin.cash/coupons). In both cases, users aren't risking the loss of their capital to fiat manipulation or wild tokenomics. 

Both of these time-locked staking apps are perfect for a walled garden. They'll both have integrated support without any need to connect a wallet to an external integration.

This are yield bearing markets to lock coins.

## 10. Last irrevocable trust. 

An ultra-predictable stream of revenue is a wonderful thing. 

For almost three years now, the number of contracts streaming monthly payments to users has been growing, and they'll continue to grow with the fourth (more streamlined) version of the contract.  

[Unspent.cash](https://unspent.cash) perpetuities will benefit greatly from direct wallet integration, as well as better historical tabulations now available from mainnet-js. 

The next iteration will accommodate fees and payouts running below the current dust limit and propagation fee threshold.

On-chain irrevocable trusts are a market in time for users of Bitcoin Cash that know what they have and what it's worth.

## Bonus accounting.

Blockchains are great at keeping a kind of accounting ledger. Given a standard set of contracts, it's fairly feasible to map out what happened to user funds in a clear and deterministic way without storing notes or account nicknames on the blockchain. 

There is a rich set of tooling for plain text accounting that can let users manage and plan their income and expenditures in a predictable way. 

If we give people tools to make, earn and save money, it then makes sense to let them plan how to spend it. When all the mini apps are done, it'd be nice to have some limited accounting and be able to export the data upstream.

Do We Still Need Wrapping and Pegging for BTC Staking?,0,1jsrlen,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jsrlen/do_we_still_need_wrapping_and_pegging_for_btc/,4,2025-04-06 06:01:38,"A lot of people new to crypto get confused by wrapping and pegging. It usually means sending your coins through bridges, dealing with different token versions, and using smart contracts. Miss a step or send to the wrong wallet and your funds might be gone for good.  
  
Thankfully, things are starting to get easier. Some new projects and platforms are working on more beginner-friendly ways to stake or move coins without all the technical steps. I noticed BABY recently popped up on Bg premarket and it made me wonder if we‚Äôre moving toward BTC staking without the need to wrap or peg tokens at all.  
  
Even if we‚Äôre not there yet, it‚Äôs still important to understand how wrapping works just to avoid mistakes. If anyone has a simple guide for how to wrap or unwrap BTC or BCH safely, I think a lot of beginners would appreciate it."
Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Receives Birthday Wishes: Details,9,1jsexsa,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-receives-birthday-wishes-details-3969465,0,2025-04-05 17:04:21," Today, April 5, the crypto community pauses to celebrate Bitcoin‚Äôs mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. According to his P2P Foundation profile, Satoshi listed his birthday as April 5, 1975, which means he would be turning 50 today.

Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges, joined the celebration, writing, ""Happy Birthday, Satoshi Nakamoto. The mind that changed the world with Bitcoin.""

Satoshi Nakamoto registered his birthday as April 5, 1975, on his P2P Foundation profile, and this seems to be the only thing known about the Bitcoin founder. Given his privacy preference, it is hard to be sure if this is his actual birthday or one he made up.

Little is known about the enigmatic Satoshi figure, including his real name and whereabouts, whether he‚Äôs still alive, or if it is an individual or even a group. Satoshi‚Äôs birthday, like his identity, remains part of the myth. But whether it‚Äôs symbolic or real, April 5 has become a day to remember the one who started it all.

Key dates throwback
Bitcoin‚Äôs first block was mined Jan. 3, 2009. Known as the ""Genesis Block,"" Bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto created 50 BTC with the move. Bitcoin white paper was released earlier, Oct. 31, 2008.
Sixteen years later, Bitcoin has grown from a near-worthless curio to one of the world‚Äôs most valuable assets ‚Äî an appealing investment for prominent fund managers seeking to protect against inflation. With Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gaining attention, Wall Street has joined in.

And the network is stronger than ever, with mining difficulty and hashrate recently reaching new highs. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $83,686, with a current market value of $1.66 trillion. Bitcoin last achieved an all-time high of $109,114 on Jan. 20, 2025.


On Dec. 13, 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto made his final post on the BitcoinTalk forum.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, sent his last known messages to developers in April 2011, claiming he had ""moved on to other things"" and that Bitcoin was in ""good hands.""

MSTR and MSTY are my main focus for stocks. MSTR is poised to becoming the most valuable company to exist just from its AUM (Just Bitcoin). MSTY is a money machine using MSTR volatility caused by Bitcoins fluctuations. 

WNTR is available to replace MSTY if it plays out like past cycles in 2026. 

I really like these four, Bitcoin as my reserve, MSTR as my investment, MSTY as my income stream and WNTR as an inverse product. Bitcoin will go up forever over the long term, its volatility isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon, so this setup seems very very solid. This recent market crash has made these stand out.

I'm still concerned institutions /whales may rinse cycle the entire crypto market regularly moving forward (up 20%, down 20%, repeat), the way the altcoin market has behaved.

Does BCH need its own compliant Stable USD?,33,1joen5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1joen5t/does_bch_need_its_own_compliant_stable_usd/,14,2025-03-31 16:25:45,"BCH had a compliant stable USD ‚Äî USDh ‚Äî years ago, yet the service was eventually discontinued. 

MUSD is good, but in my opinion, compliant stable USDs have unique advantages.

Obviously, neither USDT nor any other stable USD is likely to launch on the BCH chain, for two reasons:
	1.	BTC supporters are highly skilled at playing politics, making negative PR almost inevitable if anyone dares to issue USDT on BCH.
	2.	There are very few users or on-chain activities on BCH, which makes it commercially unappealing. 

Launching and maintaining a new compliant stable USD is expensive ‚Äî it costs around $100,000 per year.

So here‚Äôs the real question:
If a company is willing to bear both the cost and the backlash from BTC supporters to provide this infrastructure, will it be fully supported by the BCH community?

Or will it instead be dismissed with comments like:
	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs useless, people can just pay with BCH directly.‚Äù
	‚ÄúJust another trick to maintain fiat/dollar hegemony.‚Äù
	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs centralized, so it can be frozen or blacklisted.‚Äù
       ""BCH works perfectly now. Better than Stable USD.""

That is, if a company is willing to make such sacrifices, will it at least earn the admiration from a small group of people?"

Using one L1 tx to get 100 L2 tx (if you somehow manage to balance it that way) means you have to freeze capital for at least 100 tx in front. How many people are liquid like that and can actually do that?

The whole scaling through layers is a red herring. There is no substitute for L1 scaling."

How will BCH network remain sustainable when miner subsidy drops to 0?,2,1jn7sxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jn7sxb/how_will_bch_network_remain_sustainable_when/,42,2025-03-30 03:09:49,"It seems like the incentives are based on miner subsidy and transaction fees to cover the cost of running the network. The first one will drop to 0, while the second has no reason to rise due to large block space and tiny demand for it.

Therefore, this seems unsustainable.

Edit: I've just learned about the ABLA hard fork, which was supposed to address this issue, but it's still NOT looking good: 
As of March 30, 2025, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has an average transaction fee of approximately $0.0057 per transaction. With an average block size of around 50.41 kilobytes and assuming each transaction is about 250 bytes, a typical block contains roughly 201 transactions. This results in a total fee revenue of about $1.15 per block for miners.

But generating the previously created SeedQR and using QR Mode has not produced my original wallet.

The QR code that I copied down brings up a blank wallet in QR mode (I've copied it twice and verified the ID matches the original vs. the QR seed). I noticed that when I connect to Green via Bluetooth it describes my wallet as Multisig, but in QR Mode it will only accept the singlesig Xpub (which leads to the blank wallet).

I tried in Nunchuck with the QR Mode, both using singlesig Xpub or multisig Xpub, since it lets you add keys and then connect those keys to a new wallet, and get the same problem of a blank wallet either way.

I want to keep using my original seed, but I'm not sure why the QR Mode won't work - are there extra steps to export a multisig seedQR in Jade? All the demonstration videos I've watched of different wallets being used with Jade's QR mode do not address multisig Xpub.

Note: I recently updated my Jade firmware to 1.0.34 and the new UI is different than Blockstream's help pages now - not so helpful! Also I originally created a 12 word seed, and when connecting to Green as a new wallet I chose Multisig security. I'm thinking Green has a different definition than the ""multisig vault"" wallet that Bluewallet offers, or the Nunchuck option of adding multiple keys to create a multisig wallet. Anyone else dealt with this? Blockstream customer support has yet to respond."

You're not early.,0,1jj0r5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jj0r5d/youre_not_early/,66,2025-03-24 15:18:28,"WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes, this is a bearish post. 

If you're reading this and getting angry recognize 2 things:
- You probably have more invested than you can afford to lose
- Only plebs get bullish on a shoulder spike into resistance (oh hi 90k resistance on the downside of a 3 peaks, domed house pattern)
 

Bitcoin is likely nearing the end of its dominance ‚Äî and historical tech cycles support that.

Here‚Äôs a pattern worth considering:

VHS launched in 1976, dominated for ~20 years, then was replaced by DVD.

DVD peaked for about 10‚Äì12 years before Blu-ray took over.

Blu-ray held relevance for less than 10 years before streaming and downloads made physical formats obsolete.

Each of these formats delivered the same core asset ‚Äî video ‚Äî but the platform used to deliver it changed.


Bitcoin is no different. It is a platform for the delivery of monetary value, just like VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray were platforms for delivering media. And like all platforms, it‚Äôs subject to replacement.

No delivery platform remains dominant forever. A more efficient, scalable, or integrated system will eventually emerge ‚Äî and when it does, Bitcoin‚Äôs role will shift, just as every format before it has.

Taking the above fundamental analysis into account, and now looking at the larger macro Bitcoin chart pattern, there is a Three Peaks and a Domed House pattern playing out on the daily chart ‚Äî a formation that has preceded many major market crashes from a technical analysis standpoint.

Based on the ridiculous amount of hype in this bogus top cycle, the empty promises from political administrations, and the clear pattern of platform obsolescence, it‚Äôs absolutely fair to ask this question:

Is it over ‚Äî and are you going to be the greater fool who chases more gains, only to be parted with your value basis due to naive dollar cost averaging from near all time high? 

Friends don't let friends become somebody else's exit liquidity.

First-Ever SEC Crypto Roundtable Ignites Passionate Discussions on Regulation.


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hosted its first-ever crypto roundtable on Friday, pitting critics and proponents of digital assets in a sometimes-contentious debate focused on how to best determine whether or not a crypto asset is a security."

"Bitzlato Founder Punished Twice? After Serving Time in U.S., France Tries to Extradite Him on Same Charges",1,1jiclmh,https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2024/07/18/an-entrepreneur-and-a-visionary-us-judge-sentences-ex-crypto-exchange-founder-to-time-served/,0,2025-03-23 18:11:44,"
Anatoly Legkodymov, the founder of the crypto exchange Bitzlato, was charged by U.S. authorities under the previous administration, accused of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. After 18 months in MDC Brooklyn and a drawn-out legal battle, he received the lightest possible sentence: time already served.

Not quite.

Instead of being released, Anatoly was immediately transferred to immigration detention, where he spent 7 additional months behind bars. Normally, this process takes just days. Despite two separate court orders for his deportation to Russia, he remained detained with no clear explanation.

Eventually, he wasn‚Äôt deported at all. Instead, after those seven months in immigration custody, he was transferred back into federal prison.

Why? It‚Äôs now clear: French prosecutors, with the cooperation of ICE, used this entire period to prepare copy-paste charges nearly identical to the U.S. case and filed an extradition request. France is effectively dragging him into a second legal battle for the same allegations, disregarding the fact that the case was already closed in the U.S.

This raises serious questions about justice, fairness, and sovereignty. How can one individual be prosecuted twice for the same thing‚Äîby two different countries?

For the crypto community, it‚Äôs an alarming signal. If legal systems can coordinate to keep someone in prison indefinitely, even after serving their sentence, who‚Äôs next?

Some key dates when can push it for can be:

‚Ä¢October 31, 2008: Bitcoin‚Äôs conceptual introduction. Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin whitepaper, laying the foundation for a decentralized digital currency. This is the intellectual ‚Äúbirth‚Äù of Bitcoin, ideal for a day celebrating its origin story.

‚Ä¢January 3, 2009: The Bitcoin network launches with the mining of the Genesis Block by Satoshi Nakamoto. This marks the practical start of Bitcoin as a functioning system, a pivotal moment for its existence.

‚Ä¢May 22, 2010: Bitcoin Pizza Day. Laszlo Hanyecz makes the first documented real-world purchase with Bitcoin, spending 10,000 BTC on two pizzas. It‚Äôs a fun, relatable milestone showing Bitcoin‚Äôs transition from theory to utility‚Äîalready celebrated widely in the community.

‚Ä¢February 9, 2011: Bitcoin reaches parity with the U.S. dollar (1 BTC = $1). This was a huge psychological and economic milestone, proving Bitcoin had tangible value and potential as a currency.

‚Ä¢November 28, 2012: The first Bitcoin halving occurs. The block reward drops from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, a key event in Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy that underscores its scarcity and deflationary design. Halvings (roughly every four years) are defining moments for Bitcoin‚Äôs ecosystem.

‚Ä¢December 5, 2013: Bitcoin surpasses $1,000 for the first time. This price surge brought massive mainstream attention, cementing Bitcoin as a financial phenomenon and sparking wider adoption.

‚Ä¢September 7, 2021: El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender, the first country to do so. A historic ‚Äúbest moment‚Äù for Bitcoin, showcasing its potential as a national currency and a bold step in global adoption.

‚Ä¢     March 6, 2025: President Trump issued an executive order for the ‚ÄúEstablishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile‚Äù (the Order).

Lets do it guys, I‚Äôve been into bitcoin since 2020 and would love to work on something related to it, if you guys would like to help , create a group , even help me with donations to start merch , stickers , shirts or even screenshotting ,reposting or spreading the word . That would be great. I can make a discord as-well.

"Schedule Bitcoin transactions by lock time, fees or price (my open-source project)",4,1jhnzbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jhnzbb/schedule_bitcoin_transactions_by_lock_time_fees/,3,2025-03-22 20:22:47,"Hi Everyone, 

I thought for a while about applications that could be useful for bitcoiners. I realised that there is no service on the market that allows you to schedule bitcoin transactions. 

The problems such a service could solve: 

* dead man's switch: allows someone to create a timelocked transaction that sends funds to a backup wallet if a user loses access to their keys or passes away, this would use nLockTime to ensure that the transaction is only broadcast after a certain amount of time
* Auto reset your blockstream green 2fa multisig by scheduling a self transfer transaction to a fresh address
* Transfer bitcoin when fees are low: create a transaction with a low fee and only broadcast it when fees come down, preventing it from getting stuck in the mempool
* Transfer bitcoin at a certain USD price: send your bitcoin to the exchange, or to buy a particular item only when it is at a certain price

My project allows you to do all this. It is an open-source API that allows you to post your signed raw transactions and only broadcast them when certain conditions are met. Transactions can also be removed from the service at anytime. 

Code: https://github.com/bitcoinwarrior1/bitcoin-transaction-scheduler

But if you've been in BTC long enough, you know this downturn is nothing compared to past crashes. If you can't handle the volatility, you're going to lose money.

Before investing life-changing money, put in the work to truly understand what BTC is. I started investing back in 2006 with simple S&P 500 index funds. One of the best lessons I learned from those early years is that most people don‚Äôt capture the full 10.2% ROI from the S&P 500 because they panic-sell during downturns and only buy back when the market is doing well.

Some of my best investments were buying during the 2007/08 financial crisis and getting into BTC in 2016. There have been some wild rollercoasters along the way, but that's part of the game.

That‚Äôs why I believe most people shouldn‚Äôt invest in BTC until they truly understand it. And when the market is down, the best move is to buy as much as you can stomach and hold for years. If you‚Äôre just looking to get rich quick, chances are you‚Äôll end up losing money on BTC."

BCH: It's ok to accept defeat.,0,1jehrbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jehrbn/bch_its_ok_to_accept_defeat/,76,2025-03-18 17:23:48,"Sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is not my first language.
This is not a meme post, or an attack on BCH, it's just an opinion that i want to share and maybe help some people here.

First let's get some points clear:

- Have i bought BCH over the last year? Yes.

- BTC is the true Bitcoin? In terms of it's original vision, absolutely not (I will talk about this further).

- BCH is better than BTC? Yes at everything except price (but it's not BCH's fault, it's people's ignorance fault that prevents them from buying and making it go up in price).

So, why am I using this title?
Because, even with all these points that I just mentioned... BCH will not survive in the long run, and BTC will be the only one left at the end.

Let me be really clear: I totally hate this, BCH is far superior than BTC, and BCH is THE real Bitcoin in terms of what SN wanted Bitcoin to be.

But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. The most part of the market (specially the ignorant) decided to not follow SN vision for Bitcoin, they changed Bitcoin's purpose to a SoV only, and are trying desperately to create a MoE at the LN. And people are ok with it.

And there are other problems besides that.

The entire BCH narrative besides the ""True Bitcoin"", is that BTC cannot survive in the long run because of it's limitations, and when that happens BCH will receive the attention it deserves...

But that's not so simple. When the blocksize problem happened in 2017, with the blocks becoming extremely full, solutions came to the public, i agree that BTC solution is terrible and temporary... But it was a solution. In time of great need people are ok with changes, when the next Big Problem happens in BTC people will not change to BCH, they will think of another temporary solution that will convince most of the people and get BTC a few more years, and it will go like this forever.

People will not abandon BTC after all these years because its bad, they invested too much money on it, too much effort, they will simply find a solution (a bad solution like in 2017, but still a solution).

People are prideful, they don't want to believe they made a mistake (in most cases), they want to be right 100% of the time, and if they are not, they will adjust reality to their own desires.

Another thing is that most people doesn't really care about Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin, or the white paper. I think that we care about that because maybe we are some kind of idealists. But the reality is: Satoshi is not a God, he created Bitcoin, but at the end of the day, he put at the Bitcoin code that the network would follow to majority, not the ""best version of Bitcoin"". If the majority thinks that BTC is the real Bitcoin, it really doesn't matter if BCH is better, BTC is the real Bitcoin.
Satoshi's vision and white paper at the end of the day is just a personal opinion of the creator. But like I said, Satoshi is not a God, people don't need to follow his opinions for Bitcoin, if he wanted that he would make Bitcoin centralized, he gave up this power to let the ignorant majority of people decide.

That being said, nothing that I just said means that BCH will not go up in value during this cycle. That's not the point. The point is that, BCH narrative will never succeed, because people are not willing to accept that they were wrong about BTC. When the time comes BTC will adapt just enough to satisfy people's bare minimum needs, and BCH will never get the spotlight, and governments adopting BTC doesn't help at all BCH.

And there's another problem: Since most people are ignorant about all of this, it's very unlikely that if BTC fails and collapse completely that would benefit BCH, it's much more realistic to imagine that people would never want to hear about Cryptocurrencies ever again, because if the ""leader"" failed, how can anyone guarantee that the rest of the market it's not just as much likely to fail?

In my PERSONAL opinion, it's a lost battle.
Sure, we can make some profits during this cycle, and i do believe that BCH by the end of this bullmarket will perform better than BTC, but that will be the case for this cycle, not in the long run. It will follow the BTC pump like every other altcoin, but it will never achieve what it wants to achieve, because people will not change their minds to what the ""real Bitcoin"" really is. Most of them doesn't even know that BCH exists, or that it claims to be the ""Real Bitcoin"".

I hate this, because it leave us stuck with a much worse version of Bitcoin. But there's some stuff we can't change, life it's not fair.

And even though I believe BCH will perform better at this cycle, I'm always aiming for the long run, I know that a lot of people will not like this part of the post: But today I decided to accept defeat and swap all my BCH to BTC, and I will start DCAing in it. It will perform worse than BCH in this cycle? Probably, but I'm looking towards the long run.

As i said, I'm not making this post to attack BCH, and i think I made a lot of attacks to BTC. But I wanted to share my view on this topic with you guys. And wanted to listen to your views on this.

For all the ones that will stay in BCH, best of luck, i wish you guys just great things, as I said, I just think it's a lost battle in the long run. But I hope that I'm wrong and you guys get good results against inflation, at the end of the day, that's the best thing Bitcoin made for us, protect us against government incompetence."

What's your current opinion on bitcoin?,31,1jcmtgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jcmtgi/whats_your_current_opinion_on_bitcoin/,188,2025-03-16 09:36:00,"I was in the early agorist activism using bitcoin back in 2011-13. I learned about it from Free Talk Live, like Roger did. I went to crazy Bitcoin parties in the woods in 2010-2013 for Porcfest  I mostly spent mine but kept a bit. I used to have hundreds, but I spent them in the Bitcoin economy. I didn't think this has biased me, but I fully realize it has and yet to minimize it.  I'm not a ""no coiner"" but would have been a multi millionaire if had held and not spent it to and make Bitcoin work.

And then THEY broke zero confirmation transactions which undermined everything I had been working on. Bitpay stopped working. I don't know whether or not Bitcoin was coopted... but would anyone attempting to undermine the project do anything differently? I didn't think so 

Bitcoin was the coolest. Hacker cash from the Internet designed to free us from the banks. Now it's a pet rock. All of the maxis are toxic and refuse to back change to the code.

Since maxis won't back changes to layer 1, I see a few of scenarios that could unfold. 

A - BTC needs to double in price every 4 years or the miners won't make money. If that happens, there will be a rift between miners and speculators that could crash the whole thing. The miners will want increased fees, or tail emissions. Tail emissions increase the coin supply which is fundamentally against bitcoin's only feature, being limited to 21m coins.

B - Quantum computers, or AI intelligence creates new math which weakens sha256. Nobody will update the code, so all of the value in Bitcoin evaporates.

C - Trump is successful at crashing Bitcoin down enough where the US gov can buy a lot more, then they have the ability to sink it and crash crypto whenever they want, regardless off an intention to hold it 20 years. Now we're a government project. But also, so is anything in the ""cRyPTo ResErVeS""

Theres more, but that's all I'm thinking about right now. I do think there is a way the maxis are right, but I find it highly unlikely. Must if that maxis missed the 2010-2016 run and want to 20,000x it again. "

‚ÄúThe Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.‚Äù

I‚Äôve tried listing below some of those budget neutral options to help sell the bitcoin purchases to the public as non tax payer funded buys:


- Using some of the existing 39 billion dollars of emergency financial funds ‚Ä¶ AKA the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) which is a financial tool at the disposal of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It could be utilized to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) through executive action, without the need for congressional approval

- ‚Å†Seizing (stealing) more bitcoin including those holdings from people trying to use it to evade taxes

- ‚Å†Accepting government payments/fines/taxes in Bitcoin

- ‚ÄúPrinting‚Äù money to buy Bitcoin would presumably not cost the tax payer (well directly anyway!) 

- ‚Å†Mining bitcoin with excess unutilised energy sources like Bhutan have been doing

- ‚Å†Selling other confiscated assets from crime (crypto and non crypto) for bitcoin

- ‚Å†Revaluing or swapping the existing gold stockpile for some digital gold


I‚Äôm sure there might be other ways for them to get more BTC without directly buying with tax payers funds‚Ä¶ the fact they have actively pledged to do this and seem to have the personnel in charge who are motivated and from a crypto perspective pretty competent, qualified and experienced to do so is really bullish for the longer term bigger macro picture.

Bitcoin Sell Setup: Bearish Signals Indicate Potential Drop! üìâ,0,1jatoi3,https://i.redd.it/h9zrd3vvgkoe1.jpeg,1,2025-03-13 21:31:00,"üöÄ Bitcoin Sell Setup: Bearish Signals Indicate Potential Drop! üìâ


Bitcoin's price action is flashing bearish signals, making it an exciting moment for traders looking to capitalize on short positions. Let‚Äôs break down the latest technicals and discuss a sell trade setup that could offer profitable opportunities in this volatile market.

üî• Why Bitcoin Looks Bearish Right Now

üìâ 1-Hour Chart Analysis: BTC is showing clear signs of weakness, struggling to maintain bullish momentum.

üìä EMA Strategy (15-Min Chart):

The 9 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is crossing below the 15 EMA, a classic bearish signal that traders watch for short entries.

This suggests that selling pressure is increasing, and a further downward move is likely.

üìå Potential Sell Position Strategy

‚úÖ Entry Point: $81,454 ‚Äì This is a key level where fresh short positions can be considered.

  üõë Stop-Loss: $82,000 ‚Äì A crucial level to protect against unexpected upside moves.

üéØ Target: $79,100 ‚Äì A reasonable profit target based on support levels.

üìä Key Resistance Levels:

$82,000 ‚Äì If BTC breaks above this, short positions may need to be reconsidered.

$83,500 - $84,000 ‚Äì Strong resistance zone.

üìâ Key Support Levels:

$80,000 ‚Äì A psychological level to watch.

$79,100 - $78,500 ‚Äì Potential next downside targets.


‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management Tips!

üîπ Use Stop-Loss Orders ‚Äì Protect your capital from sudden market swings.

üîπ Leverage with Caution ‚Äì If using leverage, manage your risk wisely to avoid liquidation.

  üîπ Monitor Market Sentiment ‚Äì Bitcoin‚Äôs price action often reacts to news and macroeconomic factors.

üîç Final Thoughts: Will the Downtrend Continue?

Bitcoin is showing strong bearish tendencies, and if the 9 & 15 EMA crossover continues to play out, we could see BTC drop toward the $79,100 level. However, crypto markets can be unpredictable, so always trade with a solid risk management plan.

üì¢ This is NOT financial advice‚ÄîAlways DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before making any trade! üö®

It makes me wonder: if big money is coming back to crypto, what‚Äôs the next move for Bitcoin and mining companies?
Obviously, Bitcoin benefits directly ‚Äî more capital flowing into exchanges means more buying pressure. But miners are the ones supplying new BTC. Companies like $MARA, $RIOT, and $CANG (which mined almost 1,000 BTC last quarter and is holding close to 2,000 BTC now) could be poised to gain a lot if Bitcoin starts flying again and supply gets tighter.
Does anyone think mining stocks will start moving soon? Or is the market still waiting for a Bitcoin breakout before jumping into miners?"

Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - Will generate $10 trillion/year?,0,1jadtgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jadtgt/strategic_bitcoin_reserve_will_generate_10/,14,2025-03-13 09:53:55,"At the Bitcoin Policy Institute on Tuesday (20250311), Michael Saylor said: ""**In 20 years the United States could be generating $10 trillion per year by renting, developing, or financing the assets in that strategic bitcoin reserve**"".

Would someone please explain how this works?

*Who pays the 10 trillion dollars to the Treasury?    Persons? Businesses? Governments?*

*What goods or services, i.e. what utility are they receiving for the payments?    What are they buying?*

Are the payments made in dollars? In bitcoin? 

Finally, how large would the bitcoin reserve have to be in order to generate 10 trillion dollars per year?

I'm not asking whether it's a good or bad idea, nor asking for any opinions about Saylor. These are serious questions, and I apologize if there are simple or well-known concepts behind this prediction.

The legislation is designed to convert a vision set forth by President Trump into a lasting statute, with the intention of bolstering the nation‚Äôs economic base for future generations.

Senator Lummis expressed confidence in Bitcoin as an essential element for America to maintain its financial leadership into the 21st century. She highlighted the cryptocurrency as not only a technological opportunity but also a critical imperative for America‚Äôs sustained economic prosperity. The senator emphasized the role of digital innovation in addressing national debt and preserving America‚Äôs competitive stance in the global economy.

The bill has garnered support from a group of co-sponsors, including Senators Marsha Blackburn, Bernie Moreno, Dr. Roger Marshall, Jim Justice, and Tommy Tuberville.

The original version of the bill, which was first proposed in July 2024, outlined a plan for the United States to purchase up to 200,000 Bitcoins annually over five years, summing up to an acquisition of 1,000,000 Bitcoins in total. However, details regarding whether the current bill will maintain the same acquisition targets have not been disclosed.

The reintroduction of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act represents a significant step towards the institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency and reflects a proactive approach to leveraging digital currencies for strategic economic benefits. The Senate will now deliberate on the bill, considering its potential impact on the nation‚Äôs financial future."

Possibility of price-pumping attack against Bitcoin Cash,12,1j85jjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j85jjo/possibility_of_pricepumping_attack_against/,7,2025-03-10 13:24:48,"Something I'm wondering about:

What if TPTB, after successfully price-pumping BTC over the last few years, and stifling its adoption as p2p cash, now turn around and let BTC practically deflate (27% down from ATH already in just 2 months) while

- they can claim BTC failed (in its only remaining ""hope"", as a SOV)
- they can cheaply pump BCH price merely through converting the large amounts of BTC they've accumulated, accomplishing both goals of depressing BTC price to claim a general Bitcoin failure, and at the same time causing the same adoption hindrance on BCH that high price does on BTC (fewer people can afford it, leading to fewer people to try it, increasing tx fees, slowing commercial adoption which is the primary risk they face with BCH)

Just spitballing here.

It's not obvious how such a price pump to put BCH out of reach for many could be used as a vehicle for increased campaigning against Bitcoin Cash, but the old arguments of ecological wastefulness would transfer from BTC to BCH if it had both a high price and low transaction volume. And having a high price might transfer a lot of the speculative momentum, and thus enable the arguments of greater-fools-scheme and lack of utility that currently apply to BTC as the crippled Bitcoin chain."

Get ready for those to tank too.



But pay attention to the long game: Silicon Valley VCs will take out banks with their shitcoins. They've got David Sacks as crypto czar, the SEC obstacle is cleared, CFPB is gone, and Blackrock has billions to burn. They can short everything for 3-6 months, extract plenty of value that way, and then buy back at fire sale prices. When they have cornered enough coin supply, they can launch crypto on social media platforms like X and Facebook. Overnight they'll be eating banks' lunch, they can't compete with instant free payment thru Twitter. The payments won't be taxed or KYCed so that adds to the allure.  From the consumer perspective it won't hurt to have choices other than letting a scumbag corporation store your money for you."

Some points:

* Miners only have an economic incentive to keep mining if`(block_size_reward * btc_price) + fees` results in profitability.
* The original Bitcoin project predicted that mining would be entirely supported by millions of transactions paying low fees once the block reward became irrelevant. This is not possible with BTC's limited block size.

**Therefore, BTC can only survive if there are enough transactions consistently competing for block space to the point that fees are astronomically high.**

BTC price alone is not a guarantee since the block reward will diminish overtime.

Given that less and less people are using the BTC blockchain due to its inefficiency, it could be that BTC will reach a point where the solution will be to **increase the total supply to more than 21 million by extending or increasing the block reward to keep miners incentivized, effectively introducing inflation.**

Obviously, such change will require a hard fork. If you combine this with the fact that Black Rock has recently stated that the 21 million cap is not guaranteed, I think we have a very good indicator of what is going to happen. Inflation has also been suggested by one of the Core developers in the past years.

In summary, BTC future doesn't seem bright.

Thoughts?"

Is difficult to enroll new merchants because not many people use BCH as cash, so there's little incentive for the merchant, And hardly anyone uses it because there's not that many places that accept BCH.

Here's were remittances might be the solution. The remittance market is estimated to be 41.22 billion USD only in the Philippines. If Bch could carve out a slice of that market it would put bch in the pocket of consumers, and that would be best incentive for merchants ever.

What's missing BCH to pull this out? Good old local bitcoin. A Dex where you can exchange Fiat for other tokens. 

How it needs to work to have a chance of success. 

Let's use MUSD as an example:
A simple UI app were you can load up an escrow with USD. Bank transfer or cash deposit in an ATM cashapp you name it.
MUSD is deposited in the recipient address the scrow releases the funds and keeps a fee.
The process could be entirely P2P and the only cost would be the escrow and network fees.

Tldr: remittances are key to mainstream adoption.

The address is:

I come to you with a plea, not just as a fellow believer in cryptographic freedom, but as one who sees the tides of injustice lapping at the shores of innovation.

Roger Ver‚Äîyes, the ‚ÄúBitcoin Jesus‚Äù himself‚Äîfinds himself in the hands of a state that doesn‚Äôt quite grasp the gospel of financial sovereignty. The man who once evangelized Bitcoin before it was cool, who preached peer-to-peer freedom before it was profitable, now faces the wrath of a system that still thinks fiat is the future.

Now, we both know that U.S. presidential pardons are typically reserved for turkeys on Thanksgiving or well-connected insiders, but what if‚Äîjust this once‚Äîthe leader of the free world used it to acknowledge the right to economic freedom? What if, at the upcoming White House crypto gathering, you, Vitalik, the voice of decentralization itself, stood up and said:

‚ÄúMr. President, it‚Äôs time to free Roger Ver. Because if Bitcoin is about financial sovereignty, then its early disciples should not be punished for spreading the word.‚Äù

If anyone can make this case compellingly, it‚Äôs you. A few words from the sage of smart contracts, and who knows? Maybe Washington will surprise us all.

What do you say? Will you be Roger‚Äôs block-confirmation in the court of clemency?

With hopeful hashes and decentralized dreams,

Update: I should have guessed this would politically trigger some peeps, but that wasn't my intention. It doesn't matter who the figurehead is. The folks running things are dead set on taking prosperity FROM you, not giving it to you. They lie and tell you the opposite but, watch what they do - not what they say. You are not still early - you are being manipulated.

It is highly unlikely there will ever be another legit alt season and that digital money including BTC will be exposed sooner rather than later. The sheer nature of technology evolving will make crypto obsolete. You are all playing a game of ""greater fool theory"" chicken. 

We are being sent back to feudalism and AI will inform on all of us. They'll trap more of you in bags with this next dead cat bounce. How many will say, ""this is it!"" and throw $200k home equity at it only to get taken?

Those who doubt the ""you will own nothing and be happy"" directive from the WEF is alive and well are ignoring the writing on the wall - what is taking place is easily observable on macro charts for all markets by anyone moderately skilled in technical analysis.

Take the macro S&P index for example (monthly candles): parabolic step formation over the last ~50 years has likely topped. If you know what happens at the conclusion of these macro cycles, then you know what I'm saying is actually terrifying. This bubble will burst and take everything down with it.

This was the plan from the beginning. There is a really exclusive club pulling these strings and we are not members. There's a clue hidden in the Binance logo if you're sharp enough to catch on.

Stop listening to media, influencers, politicians, and hype. It's going to cost you everything and guarantee either your slavery or demise. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst. "

Holding bitcoin for 30 years,0,1j23uiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j23uiy/holding_bitcoin_for_30_years/,17,2025-03-02 16:49:07,"Welcome to my excessive rambling session as an inexperienced crypto person talking about bitcoin and my experience and thoughts.

It has taken me way too long to get into it but I guess better now than later. First time I bought bitcoin was in 2022 to play in an online casino, but I wasn't able to send it out on the website so I just left it there and forgot about it. 3 years later found it again and it was quite a pleasant surprise of 120 euros sitting there, 4x increase in profits.

But instead of spending a few sentences dwelling on the past and thinking how early I could have started (2020, 5 years late), I'm going to focus on the present and future and hopefully it still pays off even when so late. I don't have very high expectations, I'm hoping it would rise by just 2x-3x, or if it doesn't manage to rise at all in 30 years then that's not ideal but not end of the world either. I think it seems very probable that it would be higher in price in 30 years, seems pretty obvious? Why wouldn't it be?

I'm also getting my parent involved with this, but knowing them they're the type of person who just cashes their investings once they're a bit tight on money, they're not good with money, so I don't know how that'll go, but we will probably invest separately so my investments don't get spent.

I'm probably going to live a life without much money, so I hope at least when I get old I will at least have something to work with.

I'm investing it in my bank since the whole process of buying bitcoin is never easy and convenient, I've just had enough of it, and that's something that has made me delay buying bitcoin for the 5 whole years anyway since there was never an easy safe way to do it. I don't know if my bank or government will betray me at one point but I'm taking the risk.

I was really annoyed at myself for missing buying bitcoin just 4 months earlier at november because it was at 63k euros and I was waiting for it go lower before buying, big mistake. Then a month ago I was waiting for a whole month for it to drop so I can buy the dip, and I was really feeling that the price of bitcoin will go down to 75k euros (77.8k dollars) at some point, and it recently just did, but unfortunately I got impatient and thought if I wait any longer I will miss yet another opportunity to get it for less, and I bought more 1-2 weeks ago at 90k euros. And then of course it decides to drop in price almost exactly how I felt it would, close to 75k euro range, when I just had to wait one extra week or two to buy. But oh well, not going to sell anything for at least 30 years now, at least I hope so.

Now, to add on to what I said previously, I don't have the highest expectations for bitcoin, because logically, I don't see how it could go much higher than a certain point (like 500,000 dollars), because if there's already 5% of the world having invested at least some money into crypto, imagine such a huge population cashing it out, it doesn't add up, 5% of the population getting significantly richer? If the % was lower it would make sense of course because it has happened before, a few millionares out of nowhere isn't noticeable or that affecting, but tens of thousands of sudden millionaires or many accumulating hundreds of thousands? Doesn't seem plausible. So I think there will be a cap at some point or even a downfall, maybe the cap is now, even though I'm doubtful of that. So my expectations aren't high but they're high enough where I can still invest and likely get profit in the long-term. I will regret it a lot if I don't invest anything now and just look back 30 years later at the missed opportunity.

I also invested into other coins, and I have high expectations for ethereum and solana, solana seems really good because it's fast and convenient, if we're ever gonna trade crypto on an everyday basis, then we wouldn't even use bitcoin, we would use something like solana or eth, if they finish improving eth.

Oh, and also since I mentioned casino before, yes I still play casino, and I'm spending roughly 15% on gambling and 85% on holding, responsible gambling. I just hope the website doesn't turn out to be a scam.

Does everything I said seem right? Feel free to let me know if there's anything you'd disagree on or anything else, since after all I don't know much."

Offramping low 6 figs,85,1j0ifzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j0ifzc/offramping_low_6_figs/,16,2025-02-28 15:11:29,"
There‚Äôs been a lot of posts recently on Reddit about using centralized platforms for large crypto transactions especially when trying to get back into fiat. [This post for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCryptoBook/comments/1j089f5/when_legit_coins_get_frozen_without_much/) describes how a significant off-ramp went left because a portion of the funds was deemed as high risk on AMLchecks. 

It got me thinking about the importance of researching alternative methods for cashing out, like decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer trades, especially when dealing with substantial sums. 

What are everyone‚Äôs experiences with these off-ramp issues? 

What are the tax implications of such deals ?

PS For all the scammers DMing me rn - I'm nowhere near 6 figs yet !"
Am I paranoid or is Bitcoin just a giant meme that‚Äôs gonna eventually have it last cycle?,260,1j09azl,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j09azl/am_i_paranoid_or_is_bitcoin_just_a_giant_meme/,571,2025-02-28 08:46:28,"People keep saying Bitcoin is ""too big to fail,"" which is usually what you hear right before something fails.

Feels like the hype bubble is getting way too big, and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that one of these cycles is gonna be the last. Maybe not this one, but the one after Trump‚Äôs next term?

Like, what even is Bitcoin at this point? The price only goes up as long as there‚Äôs fresh hype and new buyers, but institutions are the last ones left to pile in. And let‚Äôs be real, they‚Äôre not here for the tech, they just need dumb money for liquidity. It‚Äôs starting to look like a glorified Ponzi where regular traders exist just to get farmed by the big guys.

Or am I missing something? What‚Äôs the actual real use case besides being an overpriced meme coin for anonymous transactions that normal people never need?"

Several good friends STILL don‚Äôt see Bitcoin as any different or unique in any way from all the other meme coins like Doge, Shiba Inu, etc..  They DO see it as a ponzi that just repeats the boom and bust cycle over and over.  They think that they can get in low and get out high, because they‚Äôre different.  

But what do they do, repeatedly?  They put in a few hundred, a few thousand and watch it grow, feeling very satisfied with their investment genius.  Then it ‚Äútanks‚Äù 10-20 percent and they believe, truly believe, that THIS time, it‚Äôs all over.  It‚Äôs going to zero.  So better to cash out with a 20% loss than not cash out anything at all.

Lather, rinse, repeat.

If you look at how long the panic sellers have held their coins, most haven‚Äôt even held them for 6 months.  The majority, not even one month.  They jump in at ATH‚Äôs and when it drops, they jump out, losing part of their money, enriching whoever just bought their BTC from them. 

Until BTC gets massive enough to keep these people‚Äôs irrationality from having such a big impact on the value, the rest of us will continue to have these value buying opportunities.  Someday, BTC won‚Äôt fluctuate more than a few percent and we will miss these good old Wild West times.

Do you want to know why bitcoin is crashing? Because You're Trading Like a Gambler,0,1j02qhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j02qhh/do_you_want_to_know_why_bitcoin_is_crashing/,68,2025-02-28 02:03:19,"You‚Äôre here because you don‚Äôt take responsibility for your own trades. Simple as that.

**You‚Äôre stupid.**

Before you even dream of getting rich, you need a plan for when things go south. What‚Äôs your move if your trade doesn‚Äôt go as expected? Double down? And if that fails, what then? You don‚Äôt have a plan. And that‚Äôs your biggest problem.

Stop following people who know as little as you do. They‚Äôre not selling success; they‚Äôre just riding the hype. This isn‚Äôt just about Bitcoin or crypto hype; trading is a battlefield where emotions lose and discipline wins.

Let‚Äôs be real: Trading, whether it‚Äôs crypto, stocks, or any other asset, isn‚Äôt a game of chance. It‚Äôs about weighing risks, making calculated moves, and taking full responsibility for your decisions. If you‚Äôre here to gamble, go to a casino. But if you‚Äôre serious about growing your wealth, it‚Äôs time to grow up.

Define a clear, emotion-free strategy. Move to automated trading. No one gives a f\*\*\* about your feelings.

Ask yourself: **If this goes south‚Ä¶ will I lose everything?** If the answer is yes, then it‚Äôs time to grow up."

"New subscriptions are coming to Bitcoin Cash. [Discussion, Market Outreach]",6,1iytukk,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1iytukk/new_subscriptions_are_coming_to_bitcoin_cash/,4,2025-02-26 12:03:24,"TL;DR: We're getting Token Subscriptions on BCH, sooner rather than later. 

Subscriptions (i.e. recurring payments) aren't new to Bitcoin Cash. We've had subscriptions since 2019 with the [Mecenas plugin for Electron Cash](https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Mecenas-recurring-payment-EC-plugin/releases).

There was also a different approach taken in 2022 with the [Unspent Phi Annuity contract](https://unspent.app/documentation#annuity). While, not revocable, the Unspent Phi contract included ""automatic"" payouts‚Äïmeaning recipients didn't need to interact with an app every month to be paid. 

Looking at the blockchain data, in the last six years, there were about 75 mecenas contracts created. The Unspent Annuity had about 167 contracts‚Äïbut twice as popular in half the time isn't good enough. 

Unspent Annuity was released six months before CashTokens, the first version came out around the same time as the alpha of BCH Bull.

In 2025, there's now a few fiat tokens coming down the line, and a much richer token ecosystem to make using subscriptions easier. 

***

Over the last three years running a recurring payments ecosystem, users have overwhelmingly stated they want a few things: 

- Payments denominated in fiat amounts,
- Revocable or cancelable subscriptions,
- An easy interface, or protocol, for topping up balances.
- Transferable, or tokenized, ownership of the principal.

What is fairly clear, given adoption curve of products that have been built previously, users DO NOT want to pay a regular obligation denominated in satoshis for anything other than a novel experiment. 


***

Here's how the new subscriptions will work from a user perspective:

Alice has a software or service that she wants to sell via subscription payments to users. Users can be allowed to cancel after the first period. 

Bob wants to buy a subscription from Alice. 

- Alice has a website where Bob can select which token he'd like to pay his subscription with. Since no one wants to pay with BCH, that's not an option.

- First, Bob has to enter a token enabled cashaddress where Alice will send an NFT authorizing him to administer his subscription.  

- Bob can select his token of choice (MUSD, WBCH, BADGERS, ALICECOIN, etc).

- Alice can list different rates for different tokens, either hard coded or responsive to market price.

- Bob can choose how many periods (months, weeks, years) he'd like to subscribe for. 

- Bob clicks ""pay now"" to copy a payment request link for his wallet. 

- Bob pastes this payment link into his CashToken enabled wallet, which generates a standard transaction for Bob to approve. 

- The funding transaction has full token prepayment for the time frame Bob selected, as well as a few thousand satoshis to process each payment. 

- Alice can prove to Bob that the access baton to cancel his subscription has been sent to a different contract that allow forwarding it to his wallet after the first period is complete (so Bob can't cancel his subscription before Alice is paid for the first period). Or Alice can custody or send the baton to Bob early. 

- Once Bob funds his subscription contract, no further action is required from Alice or Bob for his periodic payment to be sent from this Subscription contract to Alice. 

- If Bob decides he wants to cancel after the first month, an NFT will let him cancel, adjust, rebalance, or generally administer his subscription balance. 

- If Bob wants to share or transfer his subscription, ownership of the NFT is equivalent to ownership of the subscription. 

***

Note that with this approach, if Bob chooses a ""stable"" coin token, the balance for the subscription is then locked to that fiat amount.  

If Bob pre-pays for a year in a fiat token and the price of BCH increases a hundred fold, Bob would still have one year paid in fiat amounts, not a hundred years. 

This approach is **NOT** fund that draws down dynamically based on a spot oracle price. 

***

If users have tried using Mecenas or the Unspent Annuity (or any other pusher style subscription service in crypto), are there any killer features or pain points to have or avoid? 

If anyone is interested in selling a service or software as a subscription, would the above scenario satisfy your business requirements?"

They close out their naked shorts and stop opening more causing the spot market to actually go up every time someone buys the underlying crypto. 



The reason is because these exchanges may short hundreds of thousands or even millions of coins, and ETF's are backed by spot coins held on coinbase, so if ETF buyers buy up all these ""paper coins"" Coinbase needs to actually take custody of the real coins.

 This will cause the bad exchanges to either market buy the coins they are short and transfer to coinbase, declare bankruptcy or claim they got ""hacked"" as we have seen in the past."

Peers borrow money from each other all the time. Banks in my country restrict many peoples' ability to pay more than a certain low limit electronically via their mobile phones.

So when people need to buy something expensive, they call their friends (peers) and together they finance something by a couple of people chipping in.

Otherwise known as borrowing money. The banks are only payment rails in this scenario, don't bother asking them for money.

Now, the state, like a bank, _is not your peer_. 

Don't bother asking the ""strategic reserve"" when you need to borrow $300 .

Whereas with peer to peer electronic cash:

- firstly there's no limits other than how much money you have in your wallet. Unlike a bank, where you might have enough money, but not be allowed to spend it all at once (because surely the bank always knows what's best for your life)
- even if you needed to borrow money by having your peers co-pay for something, you can do it quickly and cheaply. Just send them the recipient address and the amount you need, and they can pay anytime, from anywhere in the world (this is also a huge advantage over banking apps for which you'd often run into security issues if you're in strange places)

National strategic reserve means those coins are tied up for purposes other than helping you directly in your life, like your peers would.

Maybe they can be used to bail out some banks.

Or to invade some country and plunder its resources for the benefit of rich corporations.

But when YOU need that money, it'll be ""_sorry, that's not a valid strategic use_"". Unless maybe you're a billionaire who can buy off enough politicians. But then you wouldn't need to borrow small amounts."

Bitcoin Cash is a centralized altcoin that uses the Bitcoin name in an attempt to trick users that are uneducated about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I will try to explain this all in simple enough terms that even someone that fell for Hoskinson's scam would be able to understand.

Bitcoin Cash was created because a group of Bitcoin miners in China that controlled a large amount of Bitcoin's hashrate were using a secret mining enhancement called AsicBoost that gave them a 20% hashrate advantage. Bitcoin was going to implement segregated witness (SegWit) and SegWit is not compatible with AsicBoost. The majority of miners did not support SegWit because they were using AsicBoost and they wanted to keep using AsicBoost. But the users that were running fully validating nodes activated Segwit on their own. So a group of miners that wanted to keep using AsicBoost created the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.

Roger Ver, Jihan Wu (the owner of Bitmain and AntPool), and that billionaire Calvin Ayre were all pumping the price of bitcoin c–∞s“ª and Roger and Jihan were dumping a ton of BTC on big exchanges for BCH. The bcashers thought that if they could get the price of BCH high enough and make BCH more profitable to mine, then most of the Bitcoin miners would switch over and BCH's price would stay above Bitcoin's price forever. Their plan failed.

BCH currently only has 0.28% of the hashrate of Bitcoin (BCH is abysmally insecure. BCH's hashrate fluctuates between 0.1% and 1% of Bitcoin's hashrate) And there are currently only 568 BCH nodes. Meanwhile, there are approximately 98,000 Bitcoin nodes and there's even 16,810 public Lightning Network nodes. So there are currently 173 times more Bitcoin nodes operating than there are BCH nodes operating and there are currently 30 times more Lightning nodes operating than there are BCH nodes operating. Not to mention that a single group controlled 80% of BCH's hashrate for a long time (the same group that created BCH) and AntPool alone controlled over 50% of the BCH hashrate for years.

The fact is that BCH has no long term future and I'll explain exactly why in the following two paragraphs. 

In case you aren't aware, the transaction fees in each BCH block are always less than $5 worth of BCH, and usually less than $1 worth of BCH. Here is the most recent BCH block mined. As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00016007 BCH (worth only 5 cents) of transaction fees and this is completely normal for a BCH block. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00108382 BCH (worth only 34 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00064719 BCH (worth only 20 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00039413 BCH (worth only 12 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00088536 BCH (worth only 28 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00100467 BCH (worth only 31 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00228548 BCH (worth only 72 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00140906 BCH (worth only 44 cents) of transaction fees. As you can see, having almost no fees in each block is completely normal for BCH. 

All bcashers are either scammers or they've been scammed themselves and they are just too stupid to understand that BCH having such big massive blocks and not really having transaction fees means there won't be any incentive for the BCH miners to continue mining BCH after over 99% of BCH has been mined in the year 2035. Maybe the same group that created BCH and that has always controlled the majority of the BCH hashrate will continue mining BCH at a loss after over 99% of the block subsidy is gone in 2035. But will the group that created BCH continue mining it without a block reward? Possibly, but BCH's hashrate would steadily be far less than 0.1% of Bitcoin's hashrate at that point (BCH's hashrate already remains between 0.1% and 1% of Bitcoin's hashrate). Another possible scenario is that they just hard fork BCH again and add a tail emission making BCH forever inflationary.

For comparison, Here is the most recent Bitcoin block mined. As you can see, it contains 0.0163934 BTC (worth $1,586) of transaction fees and this is completely normal for a Bitcoin block. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block.. It contains 0.01660747 BTC (worth $1,607) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.01600415 BTC (worth $1,549) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.01241646 BTC (worth $1,201) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.02334249 BTC (worth $2,259) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.03144001 BTC (worth $3,042) of transaction fees. As you can see, this is all completely normal for Bitcoin. In fact, this is the lowest that bitcoin fees have been in several years. And unlike BCH, there will actually be something to incentivize miners to continue mining bitcoin after over 99% of the block subsidy is gone in 2035.

The fact is that bcashers are holding heavy bags of a centralized altcoin that has no future. Some of the bcashers paid as much as 0.25 BTC for each single BCH after the chain split. The bcashers need to keep tricking more newbies into believing that BCH is the real Bitcoin and get them to buy their heavy BCH bags. The bcashers lie and spread misinformation and propaganda about Bitcoin. Of course none of it is true. The bcashers are just attempting to trick more people that don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency into believing that BCH is Bitcoin. Many of the bcashers have been scammed but are just too stupid to realize it and the rest of the bcashers are just scammers themselves.

GEMINI RESPONSE:


The message you received from the r/Bitcoin moderators and the subsequent explanation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is largely accurate in its description of the historical context and current state of BCH, though it presents a very biased and negative view.  Let's break down the key points:
Accurate Points:
 * BCH's Origin: The message correctly describes the split between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash.  The disagreement over block size and SegWit (Segregated Witness) led to the creation of BCH.  The role of miners and AsicBoost is also generally accurate.
 * Hashrate and Nodes: The disparity in hashrate and node count between BTC and BCH is significant and accurately portrayed.  BTC has vastly more hashrate and nodes, indicating much stronger network security and decentralization.
 * Transaction Fees:  The difference in transaction fees between BTC and BCH is a major point of contention.  BTC generally has higher fees due to higher demand and limited block space, while BCH has much lower fees due to larger blocks. The examples provided are plausible.
 * Mining Incentives: The concern about long-term mining incentives for BCH is valid.  With low transaction fees, miners might have less incentive to secure the network once the block reward decreases significantly.  This is a potential issue for any cryptocurrency with a decreasing block reward, including Bitcoin, but it's a more pressing concern for BCH due to its low fees.
 * Centralization Concerns: The message correctly points out concerns about centralization in BCH's early days, with a significant portion of the hashrate controlled by a small group.  While this has improved somewhat, it's still a point of criticism.
Biased and Exaggerated Points:
 * ""Altcoin Shilling"":  The initial ban message's phrasing implies a negative connotation to discussing any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.  While r/Bitcoin is a Bitcoin maximalist community, simply mentioning another cryptocurrency isn't necessarily ""shilling.""
 * ""Scam"" and ""Trick"": The message repeatedly uses loaded language like ""scam,"" ""trick,"" and ""stupid"" to describe BCH and its supporters.  This is highly inflammatory and doesn't promote constructive discussion.  While there are valid criticisms of BCH, these should be made without resorting to personal attacks or accusations of malice.
 * ""Heavy Bags"": The ""heavy bags"" analogy is a common way to describe holding a cryptocurrency that has lost value.  While some BCH holders may be at a loss, this is true for many cryptocurrencies at various times, including Bitcoin.  It's not a unique characteristic of BCH.
 * ""No Future"":  Claiming BCH has ""no future"" is a strong and unsubstantiated claim.  While BCH faces challenges, it's still an active cryptocurrency with a community and development team.  Its future is uncertain, but not necessarily non-existent.
 * Focus on Price: The message focuses heavily on price comparisons and the idea that BCH supporters are trying to ""trick"" people into buying it.  While price is a factor, it's not the only factor to consider when evaluating a cryptocurrency.  Technology, adoption, and community are also important.
Overall:
The message provides some factual information about BCH, but it's heavily biased and uses inflammatory language.  It presents a very negative view of BCH and its supporters, portraying them as either scammers or deluded.  While there are legitimate criticisms of BCH, this message fails to present them in a balanced and objective way.  It's important to be aware of this bias when reading such messages and to seek out information from multiple sources before forming an opinion.

Recently Thanah has announced that he's going to fund the big monthly Magic: the Gathering Arena tournaments out of his own pocket for even bigger prize pools, after already putting a lot of effort into the platform.

AFoG uses a guild system where everyone can create a guild for whatever multiplayer game they want, if you're not interested in playing MTG Arena (which is pretty easy to get into since you can get plenty of free packs as a new player), you can create your own guild and invite your friends or join the other existing guilds.

If you'd like to participate in the MTG Arena tournaments, the next big event is going to be on Sunday February 23rd¬†@ 7PM EST/1AM CET,¬†Thanah's guild is called ""Meeting of the Five"". This event has a 10$ entry fee, there are others that have no entry fee if you want to try the platform for free. Make sure to join the AFoG¬†discord¬†for more info.

One such company that stands out in this regard is Swisstronik, a platform designed to simplify the complexities of blockchain-based compliance, particularly with the implementation of MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) and other emerging regulatory frameworks.  
  
Swisstronik offers a solution that enables businesses to tokenize assets securely while ensuring they remain compliant with KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and the Travel Rule. This is particularly important as the global regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies tightens and governments move toward stricter oversight. For many companies, navigating this regulatory environment can be a challenge, but Swisstronik is positioning itself as an enabler of seamless integration into the Web3 space while adhering to these crucial compliance standards.  
  
The platform also leverages private computing, a key feature that enhances privacy and security in the AI and Web3 ecosystems. By adopting private computing, Swisstronik can help businesses harness the power of blockchain and decentralized technologies without sacrificing security or user privacy. This is vital as the industry moves toward more sophisticated applications involving AI, which can be integrated into blockchain solutions without compromising sensitive information.  
  
With the upcoming launch of Swisstronik‚Äôs TGE (Token Generation Event), the project is poised to attract attention from investors looking for ways to support compliant Web3 adoption. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, projects like Swisstronik that provide clear and secure pathways to regulatory compliance will play a crucial role in ensuring that the Web3 ecosystem grows sustainably and legally.  
  
For those already invested in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, projects like Swisstronik represent an opportunity to be part of the next phase of blockchain adoption‚Äîone that prioritizes compliance and security. As regulations continue to shape the future of crypto, solutions that bridge the gap between innovation and compliance will be critical to long-term success.

Still on the cypherpunk mailing list in 2000 under his dnet .com email

Wrote a manifesto in 2001 about making a mark without leaving a trace

Subscriber to cryptome.org in 2001


Early Signs of a Bitcoin-like Mindset

In 2003, Dorsey posted a bio mentioning his interest in crypto, pseudonyms, and 4 AM hacks

That same year, he declared he was ending his dependence on the U.S. dollar and was creating a barter network

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin‚Äôs Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor‚Äôs adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin‚Äôs source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack‚Äôs known hacking hours.

Bitcoin‚Äôs source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address‚ÄîJack was in California.

January 11, 2009: First Bitcoin transaction occurs‚Äîthis is Jack‚Äôs mother‚Äôs birthday.

November 19, 2009: Satoshi joins the Bitcoin forum‚Äîthis is Jack‚Äôs birthday.

May 3, 2010: Satoshi‚Äôs last mined block‚Äîthis is Jack‚Äôs father‚Äôs birthday.


Dorsey's Bitcoin Connections Post-Satoshi Disappearance

Jack‚Äôs San Francisco address was 2 Mint Plaza (jD2m)‚Äîhe later sent Bitcoin to addresses containing ""jD2m.""

Satoshi tells Martti Malmi he is ""busy with work""‚ÄîJack was busy launching Square (now Block).

December 5, 2010: Satoshi advises against donating Bitcoin to Wikileaks.

December 14, 2010: Twitter receives a secret court order to turn over information about Wikileaks.

December 13, 2010: Satoshi disappears.

March 28, 2011: Jack becomes Executive Chairman of Twitter while still CEO of Square.

April 23, 2011: Satoshi sends his last email.

May 23, 2011: Twitter‚Äôs tech lead suggests Bitcoin integration.


Jack's Public Relationship with Bitcoin

September 2012: Jack calls Bitcoin an ""amazing movement"" and suggests Square will adopt it if widely accepted.

2013: Alyssa Milano, Jack's best friend, releases Hacktivist, a novel featuring a protagonist living a double life behind a pseudonym.

March 31, 2014: Square announces Bitcoin acceptance.

September 8, 2014: Satoshi‚Äôs email is hacked, and the hacker claims knowledge of Satoshi‚Äôs connection to St. Louis (Jack's hometown).

2015: Milano releases Hacktivist 2, where the protagonist‚Äôs famous pseudonym is hijacked, featuring a logo similar to Gavin Andresen‚Äôs Bitcoin Faucet logo.

August 15, 2015: Satoshi reappears on the Bitcoin mailing list amid the block size debates, sparking doubts about the authenticity of the return.

October 15, 2015: Jack becomes permanent CEO of Twitter.

2018: Square releases a children's book about the ""Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto,"" where Satoshi resembles Jack.


Recent Jack Dorsey & Bitcoin Connections

April 20, 2020: Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi‚ÄîJack coyly replies he wouldn‚Äôt admit it if he were. Unlike Szabo, Back, and Finney, Jack never outright denies it.

May 25, 2020: 145 old Bitcoin addresses sign a message calling Craig Wright a fraud. One of these addresses starts with ""1jak"" (Jack‚Äôs pseudonym). Another includes ""HiSQ"" (SQ = Square, Jack‚Äôs company).

February 2022: Jack starts wearing a Satoshi t-shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast, then at the Super Bowl.

October 27, 2023: At a conference, Jack states, ""Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.""

Early 2024: Craig Wright‚Äôs attorneys argue that if he is not Satoshi, the real Satoshi should come forward to refute the claim. Jack, through his involvement in the COPA v. Wright lawsuit, does exactly that.

July 21, 2024: Jack posts on Nostr: ""I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.""

August 28, 2024: Jack thanks Hal Finney (now deceased) on Nostr.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

Wondering where to go/who to talk to about making a crypto medium of exchange,0,1iopfsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1iopfsm/wondering_where_to_gowho_to_talk_to_about_making/,6,2025-02-13 12:11:27,"I‚Äôve had a concept of a stable medium of exchange for a while and would want to make it a reality. I just have no idea who to talk to and where to look in terms of making it. And would also like some feedback and criticism on my concept. If anyone has any advice to provide that would be greatly appreciated

Here's an explanation of the system as requested...

The concept surrounds balancing out 3 different extremes that apply to all currencies used in society. Equality/Equity (tax rate), Centralization/Decentralization (tax allocation), and Inflation/Decentralization (supply-demand).

I approach it using a 3D graph (x: tax rate, y: tax allocation, z: supply-demand).  Once doing this, you see that the X-axis extremes are: 100% - 0% tax.  The Y-axis extremes are: All the tax goes to the government (Centralization) - All tax goes to the people (Decentralization/UBI).  The Z-axis extremes are: Supply outpaces demand (Inflation) - Demand outpaces supply (Deflation).

Once graphing it out, you see that they are equal opposites of each other... the reasons inflation is good are the reasons that deflation is bad and vice versa... this applies to all the axes.  So the logical conclusion for a proper medium of exchange is to not have any leaning toward the extremes (x,y,z +/-)...

Once you have that conclusion, you see that the perfect medium would consist of a... 50% tax rate (sounds high but I can get into it*) where half of the tax goes to the government, through a split of equality/equity means (can get into that later too**), and the other half of the tax goes into UBI, also through equality/equity means, and has a per capita supply (matching supply to demand).  Doing this cancels out all the extremes and leaves you at (0,0,0) on the graph.

The point of this currency is to provide an autonomous medium of exchange that balances out the extremes of manipulation of value... the current issue I'm having is to find a way to produce it/receive constructive criticism on what may be wrong with it and how to improve it.

*a majority of this tax is refunded... its ""high"" because it's part of the calculation
**Equality/equity means has to do with the splitting of funds... for example: 100$ needs to be split between 2 people through equality/equity means.  Person 1 previously had 10$ and Person 2 previously had 90$.  The new 100$ is split into 2 portions, 50$ into the equality portion and 50$ into the equity portion.  In the equality portion, that 50$ is split based on the amount of people.  Therefore, both Person 1 and 2 will receive 25$ of this portion.  The equity portion is split based on equity.  Person 1 has 10% of the total previously owned capital and Person 2 has 90% of the previously owned capital.  Therefore, Person 1 receives 5$ and Person 2 receives 45$. In the end, Person 1 received 30$ (now at 40$ total) and Person 2 received 70$ (now at 160$ total)"

2. API access to trading account

3. Bot written by me which makes trades on some primitive logic - limit orders trading which produce profit after fees

4. Bot integrated with mobile messenger chat so I can give commands from my phone based on market conditions etc. It is pretty convenient and looks like this integration plays a big role on getting profit.

It works with Spot market only for now and I am researching for a development. It is 10% profit from whole amount for like 5 months span. Have any ideas what are the vectors which I need to look next.

For now to achieve X profit I need to make buy-sell order for an amount like 400 times X.

I am experienced in Java and ready to write any bots etc.

I am also researching on integrating AI for analysis.

Would you trust Bitcoin if it wasn't yours?,213,1in7gnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1in7gnz/would_you_trust_bitcoin_if_it_wasnt_yours/,35,2025-02-11 13:46:06,"Been thinking a lot about self-custody lately. Bitcoin was built on the idea of being your own bank, but somehow, people still leave their coins on exchanges, in custodial wallets, or even with ‚Äútrusted‚Äù third parties.

I‚Äôve always kept my BTC in my own wallets, but ever since I started using BananaGun for trading, and I realized how much control actually matters. The bot generates a personal wallet for you, which is great for security, but also means no one else should ever have access. If I let someone else use it, I might as well just hand them my private keys.

It made me wonder why are so many people comfortable trusting someone else with their Bitcoin? Do you think most people actually understand self-custody, or are we just one big exchange collapse away from another wake-up call?"

[Meta] Regarding the future of the subreddit,107,147779o,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/147779o/meta_regarding_the_future_of_the_subreddit/,35,2023-06-11 17:18:21,"A bit late notice compared to a lot of the other subreddits, but I'm considering having this subreddit join the protest against the API changes by taking /r/crypto private from 12th - 14th (it would be 12th midday CET, so several hours out from when this is posted). 

**Does the community here agree we should join?** If I don't see any strong opposition then we'll join the protest.

(Note, taking it private would make it inaccessible to users who aren't in the ""approved users"" list, and FYI those who currently are able to post are already approved users and I'm not going to clear that list just for this.)

After that, I'm wondering what to do with the subreddit in the future.

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement). Lemmy/kbin are closest options right now, but we still need a trustworthy host, and then there's the obvious problem of discoverability/usability and getting newcomers to bother joining. 

##Does anybody have suggestions for where the community could move?

Resurrecting an old topic - does Snapchat employ E2EE?,10,1k14y1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1k14y1r/resurrecting_an_old_topic_does_snapchat_employ/,4,2025-04-17 00:05:33,"I posted this (or similar) article awhile ago: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68056421

TL;DR: British person sends a message in SnapChat *""On my way to blow up the plane (I'm a member of the Taliban).""* in a group chat with friends as a joke at Gatwick airport (via the WiFi) before departing. UK authorities (somehow) picked it up and flagged it to Spanish authorities while he was mid-flight. Two Spanish jets were sent to flank the aircraft until it was grounded, searched, and then the British person was arrested.

There's been a few theories:

* TLS was MITM'd at the airport - not one I fully understand, I'm guessing by means of injecting a CA, but this is extremely uncommon, I don't think any airport does this, maybe Kazakhstan.

* SnapChat is not E2EE. At RWC 2019 Snapchat [presented](https://rwc.iacr.org/2019/slides/snap.pdf) enabling E2EE for Snaps (video content), but there was nothing said about messages. It is even possible that one to one messages are E2EE, but maybe not group chats.

* SnapChat does client side scanning and flags anything inappropriate.

* Someone in the group chat reported/flagged the message.

Curious what people think? I think all the above points except the TLS MITM are plausible both independently and together. There doesn't seem to be any current reverse engineering analysis of the SnapChat app, so I'm not sure anything is confirmed."

**After helpful feedback, it is clear that the SAS-ROS Cipher, along with the SAS-RCS and SAS-RBS encryption algorithms, contains fundamental cryptographic weaknesses and should not be used to secure any sensitive data under any circumstances. These algorithms, along with the associated tools, are not suitable for real-world security applications and are intended solely for experimental and educational purposes.**

\----------------------------------------

I'm an independent developer with a long-standing interest in cryptographic systems and secure algorithm design. Over the past year, I‚Äôve been working on a symmetric key-based random substitution cipher and a pair of encryption algorithms built on it.

This effort has led to the creation of the **SAS-ROS Cipher** (*Random Object Substitution*), and two encryption algorithms that build on it:

* **SAS-RCS** (*Random Character Substitution*) .
* **SAS-RBS** (*Random Binary Substitution*) .

These algorithms, implementation, documentation and related tools are available as a part of the **free** & **open-source** **SAS-ROSET** Project. ***Credits will be given on the project website's Credits page.***

# .

# Note

This post is not intended to market or promote a product. My goal is to:

* Share the design with the cryptographic community
* Invite review and critique of the theoretical model
* Explore potential weaknesses and attack surfaces
* Learn from experts and enthusiasts alike

I fully understand that substitution-based systems are often considered weak or outdated. However, I believe the **dynamic, randomized nature** of this cipher and its encryption algorithms offers a fresh perspective on how substitution can be applied. Even if not practical for production, it may prove valuable as a hybrid component ‚Äî or at the very least, serve as an educational tool for those exploring cryptographic design.

In this post and the official documentation, I‚Äôve shared all current findings, conclusions, and assumptions. These are subject to change as research progresses. I also acknowledge that **some conclusions may be inaccurate or incomplete**, which is why **further analysis and external input are essential**. The **algorithms remain open to improvement**, and **contributions from the community** are not only welcome ‚Äî **they‚Äôre genuinely appreciated, and will be credited**.

***If you find any part of the official documentation unclear or feel that it lacks important details, please don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know - I‚Äôll do my best to address it as quickly as possible.***

# Overview of SAS-ROS Cipher

**SAS-ROS** (Saaiq Abdulla Saeed's Random Object Substitution) is a randomized, key-driven substitution cipher. It performs object-level substitution by using two keys ‚Äî a **Dynamic Key** (a permutation of objects) and a **Static Key** (a permutation of indexes) which together represents a **substitution table**. Unlike traditional substitution ciphers, it introduces randomized transformations determined by keys. The cipher is  format-agnostic: an ‚Äúobject‚Äù can be a character, bit, frequency, etc.

**Dynamic Key** \- (Object Array) A randomly shuffled set of *objects.*  `Example: for the characters ""abcdef"" a Dynamic Key permutation can be: { c, e, a, d, f, b }`

**Static Key** \- (Index Array) A randomly shuffled set of indexes (0 to N‚Äì1) `Example: { 2, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3 }`

These two types of keys with SAS-ROS methods form a **bijective mapping**, hence a **substitution table**.

There are two methods to perform the ROS Cipher, which are inverses of each other. Therefore, if one method is used for encryption, the other can be used for decryption, and vice versa. Below is a quick demonstration for **SAS-ROS Method 1 (m1)**:

    Dynamic Key: { j, i, d, a, h, c, g, f, e, b }
    Static Key : { 4, 8, 2, 7, 1, 6, 0, 5, 9, 3 }
    Data: b
    1. Locate the index of 'b' in Dynamic Key - [9]
    2. Retrieve the integer in the [9] index of the Static Key - 3
    3. Identify the character in the [3] index of Dynamic Key - 'a'
    4. Substitute 'b' to 'a'
    Output: a

The **effective key space** for the SAS-ROS Cipher is **L! (factorial of the key length)**, representing all possible permutations of a set of `L` distinct objects ‚Äî essentially all possible substitution tables.  
This large key space is what provides the foundation for the cipher‚Äôs resistance to brute-force attacks, especially when used with sufficiently large key lengths.

*Refer to the official documentation for more details including methods, laws, attacking.*

# .

# Overview of SAS-RCS/RBS Encryption Algorithms

The **SAS-RCS** (Random Character Substitution) and **SAS-RBS** (Random Binary Substitution) algorithms are built around the SAS-ROS Cipher but introduce **several additional layers of transformation** to enhance security and usability.

Each algorithm is tailored to a specific data type:

* **SAS-RCS** is optimized for Text-Level Encryption
* **SAS-RBS** is optimized for Binary-Level Encryption

Unlike the core SAS-ROS Cipher - which uses a single Dynamic Key and Static Key pair - these algorithms employ:

* **A single Dynamic Key**
* **Multiple Static Keys**, enabling the generation of **multiple substitution tables**

This approach helps **mitigate frequency analysis** and increases overall variability.

Both algorithms also include two key steps:

1. **Obfuscation:** Extra data objects are inserted into the original data based on a fixed **n:m ratio**. That is, for every **n data objects**, add **m random objects** (objects drawn from the Dynamic Key).
2. **Randomized Shuffling:** The entire data set undergoes a **deterministic shuffle** using all Static Keys, which act as sources of random numbers used for swapping operations while shuffling.

# .

# Key Length & Key Space

These algorithms support **variable key lengths** of up to approximately **1,050,000 objects**.

* For a key length `L`, the effective key space is **L! (L factorial)**, representing all permutations of a key of that length.
* This means the **theoretical maximum key space** currently reaches up to **1,050,000!** ‚Äî an astronomically large number.

It‚Äôs worth noting that the **practical entropy** and **effective strength** of the key space may be affected by structural patterns or simplifications in implementation. Until further empirical research is completed, the full factorial key space is assumed as the theoretical upper bound.

# .

# How to Use the Algorithms in Practice

**ROS Encryption Tool**

To demonstrate, use and test the SAS-RCS/RBS Encryption Algorithms, I‚Äôve developed a graphical tool called **ROSET** (**ROS Encryption Tool**). This tool provides complete access to the algorithms with full access to all customizable parameters. Tool supports both file and text encryption.

* Cross-platform: Available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**
* Portable: **No installation** required ‚Äî runs as a standalone application
* Customizable: Users can **tweak algorithm parameters** to explore different behaviors and security models

Detailed documentation and usage instructions for the ROS Encryption Tool can be found on project website..

**ROSET Java API**

For those interested in implementation-level details or deeper experimentation, the ROSET Java API is available on GitHub as a single .java file, allowing full control over the encryption.

* The API can be used to encrypt/decrypt both strings and binary data
* The Main .java file is provided with usage examples
* Full developer documentation is also available on the project site

For E2EE apps like Signal what stops the server from giving you a fake public key for a user?,15,1jv8tl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jv8tl2/for_e2ee_apps_like_signal_what_stops_the_server/,16,2025-04-09 10:38:55,"Say I want to send a message to Alice.  To encrypt my message to Alice doesn't Signal have to send me her public key?  What stops them from sending me a fake public key?  I believe that at some point in the handshake process I probably sign something that validates my public key and she does the same.  But couldn't the server still just do the handshake with us itself- so trust is required for at least initial contact?

I'm asking this, because assuming that its true, would for example using a custom signal client that additionally encrypts with a derived key from a passphrase or something that was privately communicated improve security?  (Since you don't have to trust Signal servers alone on initial contact)"

Clubcards for the WebPKI: smaller certificate revocation tests in theory and practice,10,1jv572r,https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/610,5,2025-04-09 08:00:45,"To implement public key infrastructure for protocols such as TLS, parties need to check not only that certificates are properly signed, but also that they haven't been revoked, due to e.g. key compromise.

Revocation was originally implemented using certificate revocation lists, but those are impractically large.  Then there is OCSP, but this has performance and privacy issues.  OCSP stapling can mitigate the privacy issues in TLS, but is somewhat brittle and often buggy.  OCSP services only work for when the parties are online (that's the O) at or near the time of connection, so they are suitable for TLS but not other applications such as connected cars.

Since 2017, researchers (including me) have been working on a solution called CRLite, which is basically to compress CRLs in a way that takes the unique properties of the revocation problem into account.  But until now, CRLite hasn't been quite good enough to reach broad deployment.  It was available under a feature flag in Firefox, but even with compression the CRLs were too large.

At Real World Crypto 2025, John Schanck announced that he has implemented a CRLite variant to be rolled out to Firefox, which is currently enabled by default in Desktop Firefox Nightly.  The new system uses a full compressed CRL every 22 days (currently 6.7 MB) plus small updates every 6 hours (currently 26.8 kB) to implement 93% of the certificate revocation checks on-device, thus avoiding those OCSP queries.  There is still some room for improvement in these sizes, both from better compression in Firefox (e.g. compression of the metadata using previous metadata as a hint) and better practices from CAs.

Most revocations are for lower-priority administrative reasons, so for mobile browsers a smaller set could be pushed with only high-priority revocations (key compromise, domain transferred, etc)."

Hi everyone!  

I want to start a virtual reading group focused on cryptography and number theory, where we can learn together in a collaborative environment. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or have some background, all you need is curiosity! 

Currently I have physical copies of these books to start with:  
1. *Rational Points on Elliptic Curves* (Silverman & Tate)  
2. *An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography* (Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman) 

And have plans of reading *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves* by Silverman, later.

Topics We Could Explore:
- Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)  
- Lattice-based cryptography 
- Real-world implementations of number theory  
- Problem-solving sessions  

We could host it in a discord server and have discussion sessions in the voice channels. We could vote on other books and areas to study, and adjust as we go.  

**Who Should Join?**  
- Anyone interested in math-backed cryptography
- No prerequisites! We‚Äôll start from the basics and help each other.  

If you‚Äôre interested:  
 **Comment or DM me** with:  
   - Your timezone + general availability 
   - Which book/topic you‚Äôd like to start with.  

Let me know if you have other ideas‚ÄîI‚Äôm open to suggestions! Looking forward to geeking out together."

What should the server do in a TLS 1.3 handshake if it doesn't recognise the early data PSK?,9,1jmm147,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jmm147/what_should_the_server_do_in_a_tls_13_handshake/,4,2025-03-29 08:15:01,"I have a 0-RTT handshake as follows:

Client's perspective:

First flight:

The client pings off client hello, then uses the early keys to encrypt early data and end of early data application record. The encrypted records are all 'wrapped' and look like application records.

Second flight:

The client receives server hello and finds out that the pre\_shared\_key wasn't recognised by the server so it uses the server-supplied diffie hellman keys to generate and encrypt the client handshake finished record, also wrapped.

From the server perspective:

The server receives a client hello message and responds with a server hello not including the preshared key extension. The server then receives some number of records it can't decrypt followed by a client handshake finished record that it can decrypt.

What is the server meant to do here? Is it meant to attempt decryption of these wrapped application records using the handshake keys and then blindly discard anything it fails to decrypt? Once the server receives handshake finished, encrypted with the right keys, it can continue?

Or is the server meant to send an alert about records it can't decrypt?"
Asymmetric Data Encryption - Is reversing the role of keys interesting or valuable?,0,1jmteev,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jmteev/asymmetric_data_encryption_is_reversing_the_role/,34,2025-03-29 13:55:21,"I'm currently testing a new encryption algorithm that reverses the traditional concepts of asymmetric keys (like RSA/ECC).

For context, current asymmetric algorithms (RSA/ECC) are primarily used for symmetric key exchange or digital signatures. Like this:

* Public key: Encrypt-only, cannot decrypt or derive private key.
* Private key: Decrypts messages, easily derives the public key.

Due to inherent size limitations, RSA/ECC usually encrypt symmetric keys (for AES or similar) that are then used for encrypting the actual data.

My algorithm reverses the roles of the key pair, supporting asymmetric roles directly on arbitrary-size data:

* **Author key:** Symmetric in nature‚Äîcan encrypt and decrypt data.
* **Reader key:** Derived from the producer key, can **only decrypt**, with no feasible way to reconstruct the producer key.

This design inherently supports data asymmetry at scale‚Äîno secondary tricks or tools needed.

I see these as potential use cases, but maybe this sub community sees others?

Potential practical use cases:

* Software licensing/distribution control
* Secure media streaming and broadcast
* Real-time secure communications
* Secure messaging apps
* DRM and confidential document protection
* Possibly cold-storage or large-scale secure archives

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on:

* Practical value for the listed use cases
* Security or cryptanalysis concerns
* General curiosity or skepticism around the concept

Is there any encryption algorithm that uses hashing?,0,1jkqsgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jkqsgi/is_there_any_encryption_algorithm_that_uses/,42,2025-03-26 19:04:14,"After looking at all major encryption algorithms, I've realized they all are somewhat complex given that the only thing they have to do is take a key and use it to ""mix"" all the information, beside authentication and efficiency.

I've thought of a simple system that would use pure hashing and XORing to encrypt the data (just an example for the question of the title):

1. Generate an initial hash with the password.
2. Divide the data to encrypt into N blocks.
3. Hash the initial hash recursively until you have N hashes of size(block).
4. Now, we take each hash block and each data block and XOR them together.
5. When done, put it all together, and that's the ciphered output.

To decrypt, it's more of the same.

I've not seen found any algorithms that do this or that explain why this is not secure. Using something like shake256 to generate hash blocks of 4KB, the efficiency is similar to other algos like AES.

I don't see a potential weakness because of the XOR's, since each block has its own (limited) entropy, based on the password, which must have high entropy to begin with, otherwise it's *as* insecure as other algos.

Edit:

>One reason your construction is not secure is that if someone ever recovers a plaintext/ciphertext pair, they can recover that hash block and then iterate it themselves and recover the rest of the key stream.

I think this shall not a major brick wall for this scheme, but it may be. A workaround for this:

To mitigate this, insert a one block of random data inside our input data, this is the random header. This works as a salt and as a ""key recovery problem"" solver, at the same time. This way no one can predict it, because it's data that exists nowhere else. But this is useless if we still use a cascade of recursive hashes, so:

We can mitigate it doing this: For each hash block, XOR it with the result of the last cipher block. The first will be XORed with the random header it is already XORed with the random header.

Tell me if this makes sense."
Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) Process,7,1jjks6j,https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/cfrg/CFRG-Process,1,2025-03-25 09:33:42,
What do you think of my protocol design?,0,1jjlye4,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jjlye4/what_do_you_think_of_my_protocol_design/,7,2025-03-25 10:24:29,"This post mentions cryptocurrency, but is about the underlying design to secure these keys, not about the currency itself. It could be applied to any secrets.

I'm a developer, working in cryptocurrency space. I came across an NFC-based wallet ([Burner](https://burner.pro/)), and thought it would be fun to make a similar concept for my business cards. My version will only connect to the testnet with worthless assets, so it doesn't actually matter, but I still want to make it as secure as possible given the constraints. The IC they used ([Arx](https://arx.org)) is $25 a pop and supports on-device secp256k1 signing, whereas my version will use cheap NTag215 NFC stickers.

All crypto operations happen in user-space in the browser frontend. This is obviously insecure, and not suitable for real assets, but this is just for fun and an exercise in doing the best possible with the constraints of the hardware. While I work with crypto pretty frequently, it's generally at a higher level, so I'm curious if there are any huge holes in my concept:

Goals:

  * Assuming I retain all information written to the tags, I shouldn't be able to access the wallet private key (secp256k1)

  * Assuming the backend database is compromised, the wallet private keys must not be compromised

  * Assuming the backend API is compromised or MITM'd, the wallet private keys must not be compromised

  * Physical access to the NFC tag alone should not be sufficient to access the wallet private key

  * The wallet private key should be protected by a user-configurable PIN code (not hard-coded and changable)

Non-goals:

  * Compromises to the user's browser is out-of-scope. This includes malicious extensions, keyloggers etc

  * Compromises to the frontend application is out-of-scope. For example, inserting malicious code that sends the private key to a 3rd party after client-side decryption (in the same way if Signal's app was compromised it's game over regardless of the encryption). This could be mitigated technically by hosting the frontend HTML on IPFS, which is immutable.

  * Compromises of the underlying crypto libraries

  * Side-channel or other attacks during wallet key generation

Each NFC tag contains a URL to my site, like `http://wallet.me.com/1#<secret-payload>`

The hash portion of a URL is never sent to servers, it's only accessible on the client side. The secret payload contains several pieces of data to bootstrap the wallet:

* 32 byte random seed - **KEK seed**
* 32 byte Ed25519 private key - **tag signer**
* 8 byte random salt - **PIN salt**

The backend API is pre-configured with the corresponding Ed25519 public key for each wallet ID.

When the NFC tag is read, it opens the URL to the application which reads the payload and **wallet ID** from the URL.

**Fetch metadata**

Using the ID from the URL, the application makes an **unauthenticated** request to fetch wallet metadata. This returns a status key indicating whether the wallet has been set up.

**First-time setup**

If the wallet hasn't been set up yet, the application starts the setup:

1. User provides a 6 digit numeric PIN
2. The PIN is hashed with scrypt using the **PIN salt** to derive a 32 byte **baseKey**
3. An AES-GCM **KEK** is derived with PBKDF2 from the **baseKey** using the **KEK seed** as the salt
  * I'm not sure if this step is superflous - the **KEK seed** could also be used in step 2 instead of a dedicated PIN salt and the scrypt output used directly as the AES key?
4. A secpk256k1 **wallet key** key is randomly generated
5. The **wallet key** is encrypted with the **KEK**
6. A payload is constructed with the **wallet ID** and **encrypted wallet key**
7. The payload is signed by the **tag signer** to create the **tag signature**
8. The payload is signed by the **wallet key** to create the **wallet signature**
9. The payload is sent to the API along with the **tag signature** and **wallet signature**
10. The API verifies the **tag signature** using the pre-configured Ed25519 public key for the wallet ID
  * This step ensures the user is in possession of the card to set up the wallet
11. The API verifies the **wallet signature** and recovers the wallet public key and address
12. The API stores the **encrypted wallet key**, wallet public key and wallet address

**On subsequent access**

The metadata indicates the wallet has been set up.

The application uses the **tag signer** to construct a signed request to fetch encrypted wallet key material. This returns the **encrypted private key**, wallet public key and address.

1. The user provides their 6 digit PIN
2. The PIN is hashed and KEK derived the same as during setup
3. The **encrypted private key** is decrypted with the **KEK**
4. The wallet public key is derived from the decrypted private key, and compared with the known public key. If different, PIN is incorrect
5. The wallet is now unlocked

**Changing PIN**

Once the wallet has been unlocked, the user can also change the pin.

1. The new PIN is provided
2. A new KEK is derived, using the same hard-coded salt and seed
3. The private key is re-encrypted using the new KEK
4. A payload is constructed with the wallet ID and new encrypted private key
5. The payload is signed by the **tag signer** to create the **tag signature**
6. The payload is signed by the **wallet key** to create the **wallet signature**
7. The payload is sent to the API along with the **tag signature** and **wallet signature**
8. The API verifies the **tag signature** using the pre-configured Ed25519 public key for the wallet ID
9. The API verifies the **wallet signature** and recovers the wallet public key and address
10. The wallet public key is compared to the known public key from setup
  * This step is to verify that the wallet has been unlocked before changing PIN
11. The API updates the **encrypted wallet key**

"In TLS 1.3, is the server allowed to send an early_data extension in a session ticket if the client hasn't offered early_data in that handshake's Client Hello?",12,1jh9vl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jh9vl5/in_tls_13_is_the_server_allowed_to_send_an_early/,2,2025-03-22 09:38:21,"I had a look at RFC 8446 and couldn't find anything either way. The old draft RFC 8446 was explicit that this is not allowed. Was this removed to leave it open to implementations, or because it is implied forbidden because clients must signal support for extensions first?

Usually server extensions are in the EncryptedExtensions or the ServerHello records. Having one in the SessionTicket is a special case, so it's harder to infer what the rules here are.

I'm noticing that clients that support early data (e.g. \`openssl s\_client\` and Firefox (but intermittently)),  don't send this hello extension on the first connection, but will happily use 0-RTT on a 0-RTT-enabled session ticket. So there is a clear advantage in using the extension anyway if I am allowed to?"

ClientHandshakeFinished indicates the client has finished sending early application data records. ClientHandshakeFinished contains the hash of ServerHandshakeFinished. EncryptedExtensions is ordered before ServerHandshakeFinished. The server indicates in EncryptedExtensions whether it wishes to accept or reject the early data, based on an application layer callback (e.g. accept GET, reject POST).

This introduces a cyclic dependency. The server must indicate whether it wishes to accept early data before the client can signal that it has finished sending early data.

How does this cycle get resolved?"
Lost after PhD in Cryptography,35,1jgcxc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jgcxc5/lost_after_phd_in_cryptography/,3,2025-03-21 04:34:36,"I recently got a PhD in cryptography focusing on secure messaging. I managed to publish 3 papers in the process by heavily collaborating with other people and my supervisor but I feel completely lost thinking what to do because I don't really feel like I gained enough experience or knowledge to conduct proper research on my own. I am barely able to come up with proper security definitions and the security proofs we do, but I can do them with enough help. Both game based or UC security proofs still seem like a very hard task. I don't mind crushing myself on some hard task but what I mean is mostly about me not enjoying any part of it.

I used to be good at implementing stuff but I also got quite rusty about those skills during the last 4 years. In my last year, I wanted to get into zero-knowledge proofs but was bombarded with bunch of literature on snarks etc. I feel quite overwhelmed by the number of papers on eprint each week and I don't have any motivation to read any of them. Mainly becasue it always feels like a follow up research will pop up from an expert in the topic by the time I start thinking of a research problem. 

I have the following two questions: 

1) How does one start developing skills to finish a paper from start to end? Especially, how does one pick a problem such that there is enough time to work on it until someone smarter or with large research group solves it?

2) Should I just quit research and maybe pursue cryptography engineering? Would appreciate any perspective/suggestions for this transition."

I was using the **ipkcs11wrapper** and **jpkcs11wrapper** libraries from Xipki. They were available at [https://github.com/xipki/xipki](https://github.com/xipki/xipki), but at some point, the owner removed them, and I haven't seen any updates since.

Does anyone have access to the source code or could provide it so I can make some adjustments? Alternatively, does anyone know what happened, or can recommend a solid alternative?

A question was posted on GitHub regarding this, but no response has been given.

Thanks in advance!"

Certainly there have been good contestants in NIST competitions/alternatives to NIST standards (e.g. Twofish for AES, Serpent for AES, ChaCha20 as a constant-time alternative to AES ; Rainbow for PQC, BLAKE for SHA-3, etc).

If you think that a certain non-NIST standard cryptosystem is worth studying why so? For example, where is the non-standard cryptosystem used in production or an impactful project?

Machines are only getting smaller and sometimes such machines don't have the system resources to use off-the-shelf de facto crypto libraries such as OpenSSL. What I learned from security conferences so far is that companies in the embedded and IoT sector are simply rolling their own crypto (incorrectly) due to a lack of option. So the classic advice to not roll your own crypto is not working from a business standpoint.

There is no sign the Embedded & IoT sector is going to stop as long as it is profitable. It seems in the future we should expect miscoded crypto to cause problems for people that have to rely on embedded & IoT devices in the future for these reasons."

If I use a password with 128 bits of security Grover's Algorithm would reduce the bit security to 64 bits, which is weak. I am bringing this up because few people have the diligence to use strong passwords that would survive Grover's Algorithm and I suspect this will be a widespread problem in the future where passwords once held strong against classical machines are rendered weak against quantum supercomputers."

Over a year ago, I worked on my thesis on Visual Secret Sharing (VSS). While I‚Äôm not a mathematician, I read a ton of papers on Visual Cryptography and Random Grids, implementing various schemes just to generate images for my thesis.

Rather than letting all that code go to waste, I turned it into a Python toolkit with a web interface to make these techniques more accessible. This project allows you to experiment with VSS schemes easily. If you‚Äôre interested in image-based cryptography or want to contribute new schemes, feel free to check out the GitHub repo:¬†[https://github.com/coduri/VisualCrypto](https://github.com/coduri/VisualCrypto)

*If you‚Äôve never heard of VSS, it‚Äôs a technique where, instead of using a key to encrypt an image, the image is divided into two or more shares. Individually, these shares reveal no information about the original image (the secret), but when combined, they reconstruct it.*

I‚Äôve also written an introduction to VSS in the tool‚Äôs documentation. If you‚Äôre curious, you can check it out here:¬†[https://coduri.github.io/VisualCrypto/pages/introductionVSS/](https://coduri.github.io/VisualCrypto/pages/introductionVSS/)

This project is still in its early stages, and I‚Äôd love to collaborate with anyone interested in **expanding VSS schemes, optimizing performance, or improving the UI**. Whether you‚Äôd like to contribute code, share ideas, or test the tool, any help is greatly appreciated!"

I've been to a few cyber conferences of recent and all the talk is primarily - almost exclusively - about PQC.

My understanding is that QC will require 1000s of qubits (some say at min 4k, other same much more) before RSA is broken.  However, it seems we're only in the few to 100s of qubits right now.

Then, there's the topological materials for QC and that seems like it could accelerate things...if the hype is true.

In contrast, i hear NO discussions anywhere about the threat of AI cryptanalysis.  It's my opinion that AI-C is here now and is more likely a serious threat than QC is.   Further, there's likely to be a huge benefit for AI using QC, when QC stabilizes, and AI can leverage it.

So, am I just imagining that AI is a threat?

NIST STS questions and use with encrypted data,7,1istg90,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1istg90/nist_sts_questions_and_use_with_encrypted_data/,17,2025-02-18 19:34:34,"**Hello cryptos.**

I'm testing output of an encryption algorithm and would like to know if a test collection of STS results of a very high quantity will be meaningful.

My test plan that I'm running right now...

1. Creation of 803 cleartext samples across 7 groups:
   * **RepetitivePatterns**
      * These are things like repeating bytes, repeating tuple and triples, repeating short ordered sequences, and so on.
      * The patterns are of increasing sizes from around 511 bytes to just over 4MB.
   * **LowEntropy**
      * These are cleartext samples that have only a few available bytes in total to distribute.
      * Some samples are just random orders and others are cases where the few bytes are separated by large runs of another like: `AnnnnnnnBnnnCnnnnnnnnBnnnnnnC`
   * **NaturalLanguage**
      * These are randomly constructed English language sentences and paragraphs.
      * Of varying lengths, varying sentences per paragraph, and varying quantity of paragraphs.
   * **RandomData**
      * Varying lengths of random bytes from a CSRNG.
   * **PreCompressed**
      * Using the same construction from NaturalLanguage, Brotli compress the data and use that as cleartext samples.
      * Also of varying lengths.
   * **BinaryExe**
      * Enumerate files from the local file system for DLL/EXE files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Windows\System32` and subfolders.
   * **Structured**
      * Enumerate XML/HTML/JSON/RTF/CSV files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Program Files` and subfolders.
2. For each cleartext, encrypt and append the output (without padding) to a file. 
3. Run ENT for the file as well as STS. STS params are: 2 million bits length and 100 streams, enabling all tests (takes about 9-12 mins per file). 
4. Record the results in a DB.

**Am I misinterpreting the value of STS for analyzing encrypted data?**  
**Will I gain any useful insights by this plan?**

I've run it for about 24 hours so far and have done over **9 million encrypts** and over **1100 STS executions**.  
Completion will be just over **3000 runs** and near **20 million encrypts**.

For any that are curious, I created a sandbox that uses the same encryption here:  [https://bllnbit.com](https://bllnbit.com)

Most of my cryptography knowledge comes from actively participating in CTF competitions, solving and upsolving challenges, and studying related papers and source materials that got my interest. I did have one crypto course during my undergrad but that was a very beginner level course.

Given this background, I'm wondering about my chances of securing a PhD position in the United States. I'm not aiming for top-tier schools, but rather mid-ranked universities (around 150-200 in rankings). My plan is to email professors directly before submitting formal applications, hoping to better convey my genuine interest in the field.

Has anyone here gotten into US PhD programs with a similar background? Any input would be greatly appreciated."

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

You would then need some way to succinctly aggregate all those mini proofs.

Is this pure silliness or might there be something here?

Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,9,1ihll6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1ihll6q/request_for_good_resources_discussing_the/,2,2025-02-04 10:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Thanks in advance."

I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"".

It then says that:

Offline path to unencrypt a DPAPI encrypted string?,16,1i9m38v,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1i9m38v/offline_path_to_unencrypt_a_dpapi_encrypted_string/,6,2025-01-25 06:39:13,"Greetings Crypto Sub!

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?"
The official AES test vectors look incorrect,11,1i7dupc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1i7dupc/the_official_aes_test_vectors_look_incorrect/,7,2025-01-22 09:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f
    CIPHERTEXT: d7c3ffac9031238650901e157364c386
    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs ‚Äî it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?"

I am wondering for any information on the security of SHA3 and its sponge function versus older hash functions like MD5, SHA1, SHA2.

What makes it more secure? How heavily studied has it been. The sponge function is still newer than the other constructions but its internal state is quite large.

BLAKE2 and SHA3 are so far the best looking but is there any reason I should look at SHA2 again because it‚Äôs well studied.

"CommunisP ‚Äì A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",0,1i32cos,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1i32cos/communisp_a_timeratcheted_p2p_e2ee_messenger/,17,2025-01-16 17:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services‚Äîwhere messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers‚Äî**CommunisP**¬†emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We‚Äôre not just another ‚Äúsecure messenger‚Äù; we‚Äôre a¬†**movement**¬†dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a¬†**decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**,¬†[CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/)¬†offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have¬†**nothing**¬†centralized to produce. Many ‚Äúprivate‚Äù messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables¬†**direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there‚Äôs no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: ‚ÄúPing‚Äù notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser‚Äîwithout revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it¬†**truly**¬†ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user¬†**rights**¬†and¬†**freedoms**¬†over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS,¬†**your normal web browser**¬†(on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open¬†[CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP‚Äôs signature security layer merges¬†**time-based ephemeral key rotation**¬†with¬†**per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it‚Äôs worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can‚Äôt retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak‚Äîbecause ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable ‚ÄúLocal Message Logs,‚Äù ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a ‚ÄúClear\*‚Äù ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP‚Äôs minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary‚Äôs window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your ‚Äúpersonal server,‚Äù so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP‚Äôs ephemeral approach is perfect‚Äînothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal‚ÄîCommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You‚Äôre Away**
   * Your phone is off or you‚Äôre not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a ‚ÄúClear\*‚Äù ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server‚Äî**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of ‚Äúsecure‚Äù while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP**¬†stands for a new age of private communication‚Äî**where you alone decide**¬†what‚Äôs stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP**¬†is more than a messenger. It‚Äôs a¬†**quiet revolution**¬†in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server**¬†convenience,
* **W Ratchet**¬†ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that‚Äôs off-grid, off-limits, and in¬†**your**¬†hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy‚Äîjust encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you‚Äôre ready to¬†**transcend old paradigms**¬†of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit¬†[CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication."

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form"

Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,14,1hwf370,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1hwf370/bulletproofs_question_how_does_it_prove_both_a/,2,2025-01-08 02:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here."

I am working on a decentralized digital identity management system, and I would like to ask for a wider community feedback.

In my opinion one of the biggest issues with decentralized identity management systems is the problem of the long lived private key loss or compromise.

I am designing a system based on an assumption that an average person is totally capable of memorizing a 128-bit cryptographic key. I made a mnemonic system for this exact purpose: https://github.com/dmaevsky/brainvault

If this really works as well as I feel it would, it might open doors to some interesting cryptographic schemes for efficient long term identify management.

While it's perhaps more about linguistics and neurobiology than cryptography, I would really appreciate your feedback on this bit before I start building a cryptographic system around it.

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?  Thanks."

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

Are there any standard actually proper ways of doing something like this?"

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process

Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2,1hd97ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1hd97ur/feasability_of_cracking_a_noncs_prng_when_the/,8,2024-12-13 04:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Attack on 16-round DES,5,1h6ddwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1h6ddwp/attack_on_16round_des/,5,2024-12-04 04:55:57,"Hey all,

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,19,1h5sn7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1h5sn7a/is_the_nonabelian_hidden_subgroup_problem_well/,7,2024-12-03 11:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H‚â§G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ‚â† UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ‚â† t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Making CTR mode commiting,7,1h2v850,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1h2v850/making_ctr_mode_commiting/,3,2024-11-29 14:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

In effect, the modified modes look like this:

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF."

Scheme for long lived auth,8,1gyrf3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gyrf3n/scheme_for_long_lived_auth/,2,2024-11-24 07:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?"

Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,6,1gwfm17,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gwfm17/can_a_digital_signature_on_some_data_be_replaced/,25,2024-11-21 06:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new. Reddit goated as always!"
Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,2,1gw6h5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gw6h5o/candidate_for_simple_csprngultralightweight/,21,2024-11-20 21:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key

An additional feature is backtracking resistance, since it is not based on a bijective function, you must guess at least one bit in each iteration to reverse it, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05079. What do you think?"

Key ring file format?,6,1gts69k,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gts69k/key_ring_file_format/,9,2024-11-17 18:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?"

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

The latest version of the code can be seen in the PR: [https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/9)"

How to apply Pohlig Hellman using a very limited set of auxiliary inputs in that case‚ÄØ?,1,1gjgvbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gjgvbl/how_to_apply_pohlig_hellman_using_a_very_limited/,0,2024-11-04 09:25:21,"So I was reading about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1321). The underlying idea is to lift the discrete logarithm problem to *prime‚àí1* for prime curves or *order‚àí1* for binary curves since most elliptic curves only have small factors in that case. But [their baby‚Äëstep giant‚Äëstep variant seems to only work when the private key already lie in a specific subgroup](https://github.com/cysecud/ecc_weak_keys/blob/master/gp_code/alg.gp#L21). That is¬†: no indication is made on how to move the key to each underlying order subgroup.  
And of course, using exponentiations to solve the problem isn‚Äôt a reason that allow building an index calculus algorithm‚Ä¶ 

If I understand correctly (or maybe I‚Äôm wrong), being able to use Pohlig Hellman would require using auxiliary inputs **as proposed by Cheon**¬†: but in my case, I only have 48 of them over the extension of a pairing friendly curve of large characteristic."

Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,5,1gjbmz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gjbmz8/mlkem_encapsulate_nonrandom_bytes/,6,2024-11-04 05:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,4,1g5jeak,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1g5jeak/safe_to_store_public_key_encrypted_private_key/,2,2024-10-17 00:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It‚Äôs worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N))."

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?

Going from KEM to Signatures,4,1g2ov38,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1g2ov38/going_from_kem_to_signatures/,3,2024-10-13 07:46:29,"Is there a known efficient way to generically convert a secure KEM into a signature scheme? I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?"

# For those who don‚Äôt know about Groth16¬†:

By convention, public portions of the witness are the first ‚Ñì elements of the vector **a**. To make those elements public, the prover simply reveals them¬†:

\[*a‚ÇÅ*,*a‚ÇÇ*,‚Ä¶,*a*‚Ñì\]

For the verifier to test that those values were in fact used, verifier must carry out some of the computation that the prover was originally doing.

Specifically, the prover computes¬†:

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]‚ÇÅ** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Œ®*i* terms ‚Ñì+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ‚Ñì terms of the sum¬†:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ·¥á…™·¥ò‚Äí197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is¬†: 1?=\[*A*\]‚ÇÅ‚àô\[*B*\]‚ÇÇ√ó\[*Œ±*\]‚ÇÅ‚àô\[*Œ≤*\]‚ÇÇ√ó\[*X*\]‚ÇÅ‚àô*G‚ÇÇ*√ó\[*C*\]‚ÇÅ‚àô*G*‚ÇÇ

# [Part 2¬†: Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with Œ≥ and Œ¥](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it‚Äôs said to be prevented¬†:

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Œ®(‚Ñì+1) to Œ®*m* to compute **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Œ®**‚ÇÅ** to Œ®‚Ñì to compute **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ·¥á…™·¥ò‚Äí197 verification equation¬†:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following¬†:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ‚Ñì=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows¬†:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G‚ÇÇ*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows¬†:

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Œ®**‚ÇÅ** to Œ®‚Ñì as part of the computation of **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**.

# Introducing Œ≥ and Œ¥¬†:

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars Œ≥ and Œ¥ to force Œ®‚Ñì+1 to Œ®*m* to be separate from Œ®**‚ÇÅ** to Œ®‚Ñì. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**) by Œ≥ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]‚ÇÅ**, the sum the verifier computes) by Œ¥.

Since the ***h***(***œÑ***)***t***(***œÑ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]‚ÇÅ**, those terms also need to be divided by Œ≥.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****Œ≥*****\]‚ÇÇ** and **\[Œ¥\]‚ÇÇ** to cancel out the denominators¬†:

[The ·¥á…™·¥ò‚Äë197 with Groth16 as it‚Äôs expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I‚Äôm not understanding¬†:

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G‚ÇÇ*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it‚Äôs equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms‚ÄØ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **Œ¥** ***and G‚ÇÇ‚ÄØ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]‚ÇÅ** ***by*** **Œ¥** ***and leave the public terms as is***‚ÄØ*? This would mean¬†:*

Secure and Private Encrypted P2P Chat in Javascript,7,1fmoykr,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1fmoykr/secure_and_private_encrypted_p2p_chat_in/,6,2024-09-22 04:03:15,"im working on a decentralized p2p chat app where it handles all the important cryptographic functions in browser-based javascript. 

the crypto functionality can be seen [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/.github/blob/main/cryptography/Cryptography.js) (it is used as a micro frontend and loaded into the main app at runtime). the main chat app is open source for transparency [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat).

i think the approach on security in this app is unique and i would like to know which vulnerabilities i haven't considered. i try to answer all concerns in [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityAdvice/comments/1ev5kqn/is_this_a_secure_messaging_app/).

i think if i stick to the principle of avoiding using any kind of ""required"" service provider (myself included) and allowing the frontend and the peerjs-server to be hosted independently, im on track for creating a chat system with the ""fewest moving parts"". im hope you will agree this is true p2p and i hope i can use this as a step towards unparalleled privacy and security.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

I've done two summer camps, both heavily focused on cryptology, and I learned about the basics like RSA and other encryption algorithms. I also learned about Shor's algorithm, and cryptology in the post-quantum world. I was under the impression that if an efficient, large-scale quantum computer was built tomorrow, we wouldn't have an algorithm that couldn't just be cracked by Shor's algorithm, but I did more research and I'm pretty sure that's not true anymore. I wanted to get your guys' opinions, on whether or not we have encryption techniques that could be implemented once a quantum computer is manufactured.

Do RFID-like signature-generating devices exist?,7,1fbu2f1,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1fbu2f1/do_rfidlike_signaturegenerating_devices_exist/,5,2024-09-08 04:43:53,"My understanding of an RFID card is you have a a bunch of inductor capacitor circuits which resonate with and reflect radio waves generated by the reader. If it resonates at 1.0MHz, not 1.1MHz, not 1.2MHz, 1.3MHz, 1.4MHz, that encodes the bits 10011.

An attacker can trivially read the card and impersonate the owner.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?"

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help."

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don‚Äôt know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,26,1f3xj3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1f3xj3e/why_does_monero_use_a_slightly_tweaked_version_of/,5,2024-08-29 03:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?"

Meta programming encryption technique assumption,15,1f2clla,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1f2clla/meta_programming_encryption_technique_assumption/,8,2024-08-27 04:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments."

Advice/suggestions on professional writing of controversial material?,4,1eogulu,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eogulu/advicesuggestions_on_professional_writing_of/,2,2024-08-09 20:24:46,"I‚Äôm in the same boat as many others (possibly you too) that disdains research/papers claiming to present ‚Äúnew‚Äù/‚Äúnovel‚Äù things in compsci, especially cryptography, because the overwhelming majority of these papers:

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It‚Äôs easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it‚Äôs much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this‚Äù

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that‚Äôs in a class all of it‚Äôs own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I‚Äôve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn‚Äôt I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn‚Äôt backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I‚Äôm eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn‚Äôt off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier‚Äôs Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here."

Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,15,1emr5sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1emr5sg/meshtastic_cryptography_sanity_check/,9,2024-08-07 18:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We‚Äôve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there‚Äôs no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I‚Äôve jumped in to try to fix this.

I‚Äôm basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has ‚Äúmathematical properties‚Äù. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I‚Äôll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We‚Äôre not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I‚Äôm trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

            std::string certificate_private) {

        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?"

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The Importance of Effective Communication and Clean Code in Cryptographic Development,5,1ej87n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1ej87n3/the_importance_of_effective_communication_and/,7,2024-08-03 11:59:32,"The writer of ""Fluent C"" has stated the following: it is better to present legible, flawed code to your colleagues than esoteric, correct code. If your team-mates cannot understand how your code works, without it being correct, your team-mates won't be able to improve the code without your help. I thought this was an insightful statement. And it illustrates a common problem in crypto development: we often see code that is secure against the latest attacks but is esoteric. Too rarely do we see code that focuses on clarity and correctness than over security-features and performance.

Even if the code is flawed, as long as your team-mates can refactor the code the code that is legible but flawed will eventually be improved and outshine the original code that is correct **but** illegible.

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",7,1eb5aad,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eb5aad/transitioning_from_an_existing_streamciphered_tcp/,7,2024-07-24 11:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught ‚Äì and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* üëâüëà)."

What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,3,1e8kqd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e8kqd7/what_is_exactly_randstorm_vulnerability/,4,2024-07-21 07:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,12,1e73o7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e73o7j/best_crypto_libraries_to_study_and_learn_from/,9,2024-07-19 08:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?"
Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,3,1e6w0s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e6w0s2/question_about_groth16_trusted_setup_also_about/,9,2024-07-19 00:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes."

Trying to create a HMAC length extension toy attack,5,1e3dyvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e3dyvt/trying_to_create_a_hmac_length_extension_toy/,5,2024-07-14 16:53:46,"Hi

  
I want to write some code to demonstrate a length extension attack on a homemade HMAC construction. Where a signature is constructed as:

digest = hash(key+ message)

and then I want to construct a digest from the output of those two.

I read up on it a little, and figured I could do a really simple small code example in c# (if anyone can help with snippets in other similar languages it would be really cool too :D )

**My approach**

  
So I figured that if I have a secret and a message that add up to the sha1 block length of 64 bytes, then the hash of these two would simply be a single block of hashing.

  
Then I could simply take the signature of this message, and append whatever to it, from which I would get a new hash, which would valid

And so I made this little snippet:



`using System.Security.Cryptography;`

`using System.Text;`



`// secret and message, together they are 64 bytes`

`string secret = ""secret222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222"";`

`string msg = ""data"";`

`// the digest`

`var digest = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg);`



`// forging digest, simply trying to append ""appendeddata""`

`string append = ""appendeddata"";`

`// and now trying to forge a new digest:`

`var forgedPayload = StringExtensions.hash(digest + append);`

`// and then checking it` 

`var constructed = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg+append);`



`public static class StringExtensions`

`{`

`public static string hash(this string input)`

`{`

`if (input == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));`

`using (SHA1 sha256 = SHA1.Create())`

`{`

`byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);`

`byte[] hashBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);`



`StringBuilder hash = new StringBuilder();`

`foreach (byte b in hashBytes)`

`{`

`hash.Append(b.ToString(""x2""));`

`}`

`return hash.ToString();`

`}`

`}`

`}`

  
However, this does'nt work. The two final hashes are always different.

  
What have i misunderstood, why are these values not adding up?"

Which subgroup to select(2q or q) for finite field discrete logarithm?,5,1e0gtt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e0gtt9/which_subgroup_to_select2q_or_q_for_finite_field/,6,2024-07-11 00:00:47,"From my understanding, in order to have maximally hard discrete logarithm instances, one needs to instantiate it over an adequately large prime modulus p such that p = 2q + 1 where q is a prime number. Doing so allows the creation of subgroups of order 2, q, and 2q.

When a generator that generates the subgroup of order q is used for discrete logarithm, you lose half the possible outputs compared to the subgroup of order 2 but you also prevent leakage regarding the output from what I recall. The converse is true when you use a generator for the 2q order group(more outputs but you leak a bit of information). This means from a cryptographic perspective, both options are effectively similar(either q possible outputs or 2q possible outputs but you can exclude one half of the outputs due to leakage).

I would like to know if there would be any reason to prefer one subgroup over another for uses of finite field discrete logarithms in this scenario."

Implementing password recovery in my app,8,1dxew5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1dxew5m/implementing_password_recovery_in_my_app/,2,2024-07-07 07:00:09,"Hello. I have an Android App that stores encrypted data using a key derived from user entered password (PBKDF2). If any user forgets their password, they loose access to all their data. Hence, I am trying to implement a password recovery feature that is hacker resistant, including in cases where the phone may be rooted and the sqlite database is accessible.

Here's my solution. I randomly generate and store an internal password in the app. I then encrypt the user's password using this internal password using AES, and further encrypt the output and the user's email using my RSA public key. I store this RSA encrypted value.

If the user forgets their password, I submit the RSA encrypted value to my website. The website will decrypt the value using my private key and will email the app encrypted user password value to the email address found, as an attachment. On clicking the attachment, the user password is decrypted using the internal password, user is logged in and made to change their password.

Do you foresee any weaknesses with this approach? I guess if the user's phone is compromised, then the person holding the phone can check emails and retrieve the password. So perhaps adding a secret question and answer would help, but some people end up forgetting the answer to that as well."

    const uint64_t rs = Seed >> 32 | Seed << 32;
    
    Hash += rs + 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
    
    lcg += Seed + 0x5555555555555555;
    
    Seed ^= Hash;
    
    const uint64_t out = lcg ^ rs;
    
    *Seed0 = Seed; *lcg0 = lcg; *Hash0 = Hash;
    
    return( out );

`}`

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single ""compressed"" PRNG output):

    v = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
    v ^= prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );"

my idea is to use the pki for signing documents that can be verified later. the goal would be to ease the task of the verifier, not using some arcane formats, but something you can check with standard tools.

what i don't get is that certs expire. will the signature be meaningful after many years? assuming many items on the cert chain are now expired or revoked. the question is: was it valid at the time.

also, are there any tools to easily verify a document? something i can trust an average IT guy can do. it appears to me that openssl can do it in some steps, which is kinda acceptable.

is this even a good idea?"

Is encrypting screenshots using asymmetric encryption feasible?,5,1db0lu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1db0lu5/is_encrypting_screenshots_using_asymmetric/,15,2024-06-08 06:16:07,"So, I've had a bit of a stupid idea for my next programming project, which would be implementing a Microsoft Recall alternative for Linux where the data is encrypted. I've now written a bit of code and have come to the point where I'd need to encrypt the files. My plan was to use asymmetric encryption where the secret key is encrypted using a user-provided password so that the user needs to decrypt the private key to view the screenshots taken / data extracted from the screenshots. 

I have now learned that asymmetric encryption is very slow and it's generally not designed to encrypt large chunks of data, so I'm not sure how to continue. Do you think asymmetric encryption is feasible for this? Any idea how else to do the encryption? Ideally I would like for the server that takes the screenshots to not have a key that can decrypt the files since that wouldn't be as secure. "

Say I have two ciphertext c1 = E(K, iv1, p1), c2 = E(K, iv2, p2), and authentication tag a1, a2 for c1 and c2 respectively. 

I can combine them with XOR to get c3 = c1 ^ c2, and somehow obtain a3 by some publicly known function f(a1, a2) 

Someone in possession of K, given c3, a3, iv1, iv2, should be able to verify that c3 is indeed composed of some XOR combinations of ciphertext that they have encrypted in the past. 

To be more precise, what I'm looking for is some kind of homomorphic encryption that respects XOR, which can easily be done with a stream cipher, but I'm also wondering if it's possible to preserve authenticity, at least as far as whether the ciphertext is composed of authentic ciphertext."

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis and Fault Injection Attack,8,1d6gzb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1d6gzb7/rules_to_defend_against_power_analysis_and_fault/,5,2024-06-02 11:21:55,"I have compiled a list of rules on how to defend against power analysis and fault injection attacks

[here](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/rules-to-defend-against-fault-and-power-analysis-attacks).

Here is a summary of the attacks and defenses:

1. Power Analysis Attack: What Is It?
   1. Simple Power Analysis
      1. Random Noise: A Simple Defense Against Simple Power Analysis
      2. Masking: A Second Defense
      3. Montgomery Ladder: A Third Defense
   2. Introduction to Differential Power Analysis and Higher-Order Analysis
   3. Defenses Against Differential Power Analysis
      1. Higher-Order Masking
      2. Blinding for Public-Key Cryptography
      3. Perform Decoy Operations
      4. Montgomery Ladder
      5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values
      6. Operation Shuffling
      7. Non-Deterministic Processor 

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis

1. Apply noise by executing programs in parallel on several CPU cores.
2. Apply masking. This can defend up to the nth-order differential power analysis attack. However, an (n+1)th order differential power analysis attack can bypass this defense.
3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

1. Fault Injection Attack: What Is It?
   1. How Practical Is It?
   2. Why You Should Still Care About Fault Injection Attacks Demanding Physical Access
   3. Voltage Glitch Attack: A Practical, Remote Fault Injection Attack Targeting Intel Systems
   4. Electromagnetic Fault Injection Attack
2. Defenses Against Fault Injection Attack
   1. Use Nontrivial Constants
   2. Clear Variables After Use
   3. Search for Fault-Injection Resistant Implementations

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

Help needed: analogies for visualizing a brute force attack on 256 bits,7,1d0sucl,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1d0sucl/help_needed_analogies_for_visualizing_a_brute/,1,2024-05-25 22:46:46,"**EDIT**: Found it.

I need your help looking for a page about visualizing a brute force attack on either 128 bits or 256 bits (I can't recall exactly). I stumbled upon it some years ago and don't remember much about it. It may not even be online any longer. If I recall correctly, it was an analogy of a person talking with a bucket of dirt or water some large distance (perhaps across a country? Earth to Sun? Not sure). The analogy was approaching the infeasibility of brute forcing these insanely large numbers. It wasn't showing the impracticality via time though.

I'm familiar with Bruce Schneier's explanation on the [thermodynamic limits of brute forcing a 256-bit symmetric key](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html). I typically refer to this analogy.
Jeff Bonwick, the creator of ZFS, blogs about [boiling oceans with 128 bits](https://web.archive.org/web/20061111054630/http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/date/20040925#128_bit_storage_are_you). There is this blog about [searching grains of sand for a 128-bit key](https://richardwarrender.com/2016/04/encrypt-data-using-aes-and-256-bit-keys/).

Anyone familiar with any other analogies for brute forcing 128-bits or 256-bits? On the off-chance, is someone here familiar with the post I'm looking for? It might not even be related to brute force, but just visualizing the sheer size of the number.

Thanks."
Rules for Constant-Time Programming,11,1d0o0li,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1d0o0li/rules_for_constanttime_programming/,17,2024-05-25 18:07:08,"When programming cryptosystems there are several rules cryptographic engineers need to follow to ensure their cryptosystems are constant-time whenever secret data is managed.

I am researching those and have compiled [the in-progress list](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/timing-attack-defenses) here.

I summarize it below. What suggestions would you have to improve this list?:

No program is vulnerable to timing attacks if its execution time is independent of any secret value.

1. When considering using a third-party library consider if the third-party library must manage secret information. If so check if the third-party library has been tested and verified to be constant-time. Most [\~do not\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf)!
2. \~Only use secret information in a computation if the secret's value does not affect the system resources used nor duration of said computation.\~
3. Choose to use an algorithm that is designed to be constant-time in the first place!
4. Never use secret values to decide what code to execute next.
5. Never use secret values to determine which memory addresses to access.
6. Use ""unsigned"" data types to store bytes of data. Using the ""signed"" reserved keyword will cause the loss of the most significant bit in each byte!
7. Always generate random data from cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators. An excellent list of CSPRNGs may be [\~found here\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators/secure-random-generators-csprng) in Nabokov's excellent guide on[ \~Practical Cryptography\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/).
8. Zeroize secret data *\~immediately\~* **after use. Check out Aumasson's secure coding guidelines for a list of** [**\~secure-wipe functions\~**](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-memory-of-secret-data) **that do this.**
9. [\~Typecast\~](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#always-typecast-shifted-values) shifted values.
10. Any loop iteration leaks the number of iterations taken.
11. Any memory access leaks the address or index accessed.
12. Any conditional statement leaks which branch was selected.
13. You can assume how your CPU handles addition, multiplication, logical operations, and bitwise shifts are constant-time. Division is a unique case.
14. If you know a proof-assistant language such as Coq you should first make the program in a proof-assist language and compile that.
15. Use dynamic analysis tools against the final executable to test for constant-time. [\~Reputed ones\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf) include and are not limited to: ""ctgrind"" (a patch of Valgrind by Adam Langley from Google), ""dudect"", or ""ctverify"".
16. If you can afford it allow a third-party to do a professional source code audit of the codebase."

Are there any efforts to implement a QUIC-like protocol on top of raw packets rather than UDP?,2,1cyy2yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1cyy2yb/are_there_any_efforts_to_implement_a_quiclike/,2,2024-05-23 12:12:17,"UDP protects the transport layer from malformed packets. However, the transport layer already has a mechanism for discarding malformed packets: decryption will fail.

If instead of using the UDP packet's checksum to detect many corrupted bits, it could use the checksum to attempt to correct a few bits.

This would improve network quality in noisy conditions (particularly non-civilian) where requesting a retransmission is slower or more costly than attempting error correction.

Error correction for UDP packets is pretty much brute force, and flipped bits in the checksum vs the payload are not created equal. So you would want to use raw packets with a dedicated error correcting code.

Has this been tried?"

Required Math to Program Crypto?,1,1csyqii,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1csyqii/required_math_to_program_crypto/,23,2024-05-15 18:16:26,"Hello everyone,

I am researching what math you need to program classical cryptography for a [book I am writing](https://helpthisbook.com/fosres/program-cryptography-volume-1-math-for-classical-cryptography).

Not all the math found in cryptography textbooks is required to program the cryptosystem itself.

From my research here is a list of the math you **must** know if you want to program cryptosystems:

1. Binary Arithmetic: You have to know how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and get the remainder from binary division. The reason is you need to know how to do that to manage massive numbers stored in binary form on the machine. In addition to knowing how to do that for managing massive numbers you also need to know modular arithmetic, which is my next topic.
2. Modular Arithmetic: You have to be able to all elementary arithmetic and apply the result to the modulus operation (addition, subtraction, etc.). Modulus operations are found in just about every cryptosystem I have studied so far--from ciphers to hashes.
3. Multi-Precision Arithmetic: Public-key cryptography demands multiplying and even raising numbers larger than 64-bits in size by triple-digit numbers. We live in a world of 64-bit CPUs. When you need to store a number larger than what can fit in only 64 bits you have to split the binary representation across several 64-bit words and carry out the math operation across them.
4. Finite Field Arithmetic: Finite Fields are used in industry-standard ciphers including AES and in public-key cryptosystems such as RSA. Doing arithmetic with binary digit representations of finite fields, called binary fields, is mandatory to program such cryptosystems.
5. Prime Numbers: You \*have\* to know how to generate huge prime numbers. They are critical in protecting the secret key! There are efficient techniques for generating huge prime numbers. They are called techniques for generating ""probable primes""--numbers that are most likely prime based on a few numerical tests such as the Rabin-Miller test or Lucas-Lehmer Probabilistic Primality test.

I would argue the five concepts above are essential for programming cryptosystems. If there is anything I missed please comment below and let me know. Would love to hear from you!

Root finding in multivariate Coppersmith,8,1crqk3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1crqk3h/root_finding_in_multivariate_coppersmith/,1,2024-05-14 07:09:41,"Hello!

TL;DR: is there any library for multivariate polynomial root finding over the integers?

I'm trying to implement an attack on RSA with known bits of p by using Coppersmith, such as shown in [this paper](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2008/53500412/53500412.pdf). In my case I have three blocks of lost bits, so it should be fine. The idea of Coppersmith is to first build and reduce a lattice, which is the costly part, and then convert some of the rows of the lattice back to polynomials that should have solutions over the integers that match the bits we're looking for. Finding the roots of a set of multivariate polynomials should have a very small cost when compared to lattice reduction.

However, I'm encountering a nasty surprise in my program. Lattice reductions take much (MUCH) less time than multivariate root finding, which is the limiting factor of my implementation. As of now I'm using a Sage script to solve the system, but it is too slow. Is there any library for integer multivariate root finding? At this point I don't care whether it's Python, C, C++, Fortran or whatever, I just want something fast that works for large integers.

Since my PhD will most likely have something to do with implementing cryptography I was thinking I would do something similar for my master's as warm up. 

My current idea basically is about finding curves that would do better than curve25519 in some (however niche) areas. For example, [optimal prime fields with low hamming weight](https://www.cryptolux.org/images/2/25/ICCSNT2011.pdf) seems to offer very good performance on 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. Surprisingly I don't think anyone has tried to standardize a 128-bit security curve on such prime fields yet, so I was thinking maybe I can find a curve based on such a field that satisfies the SafeCurve criteria, implement it for atmega128, do some benchmark with existing x25519 implementations and see if mine is better. Although I'm not really confident about this idea since I might've just missed some work that people have already done on this topic, or there's something fundamentally wrong with this idea since I'm not really an expert in microcontrollers or optimized implementations.

Since my university doesn't have a huge cryptography faculty, I'm seeking advice from y'all on the subreddit. Do you think my idea would be good for a thesis or do you have any other ideas? Thanks!"

So from that one could expect perhaps a roughly 50/50 usage ratio. CFB seems to have some significant advantages. It requires no padding and is not susceptible to IV prediction (BEAST). So historically it seems we would have been better off for SSL/TLS if it had been based on CFB rather than CBC.

Something I have just recently learned, CFB is nicer in that the IV only has to be unique (you could use a counter). CBC requires a random IV. The interesting thing is that the NIST document was wrong about this in that it claimed the IV characteristics were the same between the two.

I understand the theory (mostly) but my attack doesn't produce the correct subkey, even when provided with all the traces in the dataset. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong but I have a few suspicions:

* The traces only record one round of AES, not the entire process. I'm not sure if this is an issue as the theory doesn't make it clear whether the entire trace for the AES operation is needed or if it's okay to have just one round, but it could cause issues.
* The points of interest that I'm selecting are not appropriate. I'm not really sure how to rectify this besides using another method (I'm currently using the difference of means method and I have seen that there are other methods available, e.g. sum of squared differences or PCA).

I've managed to implement a successful CPA attack using only the attack traces but I'm really struggling to understand why a template attack won't work. If anyone could give any pointers I'd be really grateful!"

So the cryptoJS AES encryption produces some [incorrect/ non standard outputs](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/293). Specifically when given 512 bit keys.

 Ideally though, can someone explain what the actual issue here is in a way that I can try to recreate myself? I understand that AES maxes at 256. So what is this algorithm actually doing with 512? I‚Äôm familiar with AES but not proficient enough to understand why this is happening.

Are zero knowledge proofs still valid when you work on polynomials mod X^N + 1?,12,1cbsd4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1cbsd4s/are_zero_knowledge_proofs_still_valid_when_you/,7,2024-04-24 02:36:30,"The FALCON signature scheme uses polynomials modulo x^n - 1.

And modular arithmetic still works when you roll your polynomials up like this. (Not relevant, just giving the inspiration for this question.)

Zero knowledge proofs operate on gigantic polynomials, that are known by both prover and verifier.

Can both parties just agree to work modulo x^700 - 1 for example?

Real world zero-knowledge provers require 100s of gigabytes of RAM and are painfully slow.

Extending this, the verifier could specify the exponent N. They could even specify a dozen exponents and get a dozen proofs to really capture the constraints of the problem."

Is producing a QAPs with no remainder a zero-knowledge proof?,4,1c9qvcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1c9qvcc/is_producing_a_qaps_with_no_remainder_a/,4,2024-04-21 14:49:35,"I followed the following blog post

[https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)

You start with some problem f(**y**) = 0, where y is some group of values and f could be just about any problem, maybe 'find a set of values y\_i for the squares in this Sudoku', or 'Hash(y) - hashVal'

You want to convince someone you know **y** without revealing it.

You convert f() into a 'recipe' of very steps, 'add y\_a and y\_b to get val1' then 'multiply val1 and y\_b to get val2'.

List out those steps as a series of constraints:

y\_a + y\_b = val1

val1 \* y\_b = val2

etc.

Now as the prover, actually input the value of **x** you know to get the values for val1, val2 etc.

Produce a big secret vector s of all inputs and intermediate values that appear in the constraints (1, y\_0, y\_1, ... y\_n, val1, val2, val3 ...)

Construct a giant matrix equation of the form

As . Bs - Cs = **0**

where rows of A and B have one or two non-zero values, and rows of C have one non-zero value, and '.' is a element-wise product.

Multiply this out to get the constraints back, to double-check you didn't mess up.

Each row i = {1, 2, 3, ... n} encodes a constraint.

We now replace the matrices with polynomials (a + bx + cx\^2 ...)

s.**A**(x) \* s.**B**(x) - s.**C**(x)

We check we didn't mess up by inserting values of x = {1, 2, 3 ... n}, which, by design, should give us our list of constraints back, and evaluate to 0.

Z = (x-1))(x-2)(x-3)...(x-n) evaluates to 0 when x = {1, 2, 3 ... n}, and so we can set the right hand side to be some polynomial times this

s.**A**(x) \* s.**B**(x) - s.**C**(x) = H(x) \* Z(x)

We now divide by Z(x) to get H(x) + some remainder.

If the remainder is non-zero then something went wrong. Does that mean that if the remainder *is* 0, then we can present the polynomials, A, B, C, H as a zero-knowledge proof that we knew **y**?

Verification starts by constructing the constraints from f(), check that they match A, B, C.

Then what? The verifier doesn't have access to s to verify the equation.

What can we give the verifier to verify the equation? I'm not fussed about keeping the proof succinct or performant. I'm just learning. Something intuitive but maybe broken is the checkpoint I need"
"Keccak-f is invertible but not uniquely, can we exploit this?",11,1c8vg57,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1c8vg57/keccakf_is_invertible_but_not_uniquely_can_we/,6,2024-04-20 12:28:38,"SHAKE‚Äôs security relies on the fact that 256 bits of the output are destroyed, and 256 bits of the input are fixed to 0 and cannot be chosen by the individual performing the hash.

F1600 is not uniquely invertible, it is nevertheless invertible: from an output, you can calculate some input that produces that output.

If you start from some hash, fill out the rest of the F1600 state arbitrarily and try to perform this inversion, you‚Äôll get an input where the last 256 bits of the state are not 0 and so this input is not an allowed preimage.

The œá step of the inversion gives you freedom to set specific bits in the f1600 input. If we could just figure out some set of choices here that sets the 256 end bits of the ‚Äòinput‚Äô to 0, we have a way to create SHA3 collisions!

What makes this hard to do?

The signature can be verified because the public key's hash is part of the Wi-Fi password. This is meant to improve security in network where the Wi-Fi password is shared to many users and is basically public knowledge.

But what stops an attacker from setting up an AP without SAE-PK enabled, or even with WPA2? How does the client know the network is supposed to be protected by SAE-PK, if the only information it has is the SSID and the key, aka Wi-Fi password?

Evaluate this encryption algorithm !,0,1c4f5ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1c4f5ug/evaluate_this_encryption_algorithm/,71,2024-04-15 01:16:06,"Actually i thought of something very simple based on the following principle:

The function/algorithm which achieves defense against differential attacks must be different from the function/algorithm who uses the key.

Btw, this principle actually exist in AES (so it isn't really something new).Of course, the order in which this functions/algorithms are applied is: first, the one that achieves defense ; second, the ones that uses the key.The difference between this encryption system and AES would be that if the first function is positively provable than there is no need for multiple rounds.First i would choose plaintext size = ciphertext size = key size = 8192 bits.

In my opinion, the second function (the one that uses the key) is pretty boring; basically it can be any function that respects all properties of One Time Pad.Some specific example of such functions are:

1. XOR operation (my preferred choice)
2. modular addition/subtraction

For the first function (the one that achieves defense) i'm thinking about a simple function that flips 4097 bits for each bit changed/flipped inside the plaintext.The starting/default (plaintext ; ciphertext) pair is (000...000 ; 000...000) pair.Btw, it is easier to count the positions from 0 instead of 1.If bit (from plaintext) on the position i is changed/flipped. Than all bits (from ciphertext) from the positions:\[i ; (i +4096) modulo 8192\] closed rangeare changed/flipped.

The question is: What are the weaknesses of this symmetric encryption algorithm (knowing that you can encrypt as many blocks as you want using the same key in ECB mode of operation) ?"

Trying to understand TPM's scope,3,1byaz14,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1byaz14/trying_to_understand_tpms_scope/,3,2024-04-07 13:09:35,"My understanding of TPM is there are essentially 3 parties:

1. Manufacturer, e.g. ASUS
2. The cloud provider, or owner of a host machine which contains a TPM manufactured by ASUS, call her Eve
3. The relying party, Bob

The short of what I'm trying to understand is this. Supposing Bob trusts ASUS the manufacturer, and does not trust Eve, can Bob be assured that Eve is running an application he created as is, with nothing else?

So suppose Bob is developing some web application, call it Survey Ape. Bob makes a build for Survey Ape and loads it into a custom linux image so that if he puts that image on his own HDD it will load linux and auto-start Survey Ape. He sends that build to Eve to run on her host machine. I think the TPM can be used to assure Bob that Eve is in fact running untampered ASUS hardware. But can the TPM attestations also be used to assure Bob that Eve did not modify the linux image before loading it into the hard drive, perhaps changing Survey Ape to harvest credentials?

Suggestions for further reading are appreciated."
Looking for learning resources for CSIDH,14,1bwsq0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1bwsq0y/looking_for_learning_resources_for_csidh/,5,2024-04-05 15:50:35,"Hello, recently I came across ""A Friendly Introduction to Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman"" to SIDH by David Urbanik [(link)](https://www.math.toronto.edu/dburbani/work/friendlysidh.pdf). His explanation was very digestible for a layman like me and gave a very clear overview on how SIDH works.

I'm currently looking for something similar but for CSIDH. Many papers on CSIDH assume too much mathematical background for me which makes it very difficult for me to understand what's happening. Does anyone know of a high level overview of CSIDH that assumes a similar mathematical background like Urbanik's?

Particularly, from what I understand, CSIDH works by commutative group action where the group is isogenies acting on some elliptic curve E0. What I'm confused is:
1. How are the isogenies constructed?
2. How do isogenies even compose and commute: say I have phi: E0 -> E1 and tau: E0 -> E2, how would (phi . tau) even makes sense, let alone being equivalent to (tau . phi), when the domains and codomains don't even match?
3. An extension to 2: what even is the group? I can't convince myself isogenies would form a group under composition since composition doesn't make sense. 
4. Wouldn't algebraic actions like this be suspectable to quantum attacks? Or is it okay for CSIDH specifically because we aren't sending group elements, but rather elements which is being acted on by a group?"

But when I checked the Veracrypt user manual I was shocked.veracrylt says we shouldn't use their encryption/ hidden volume on SSDs and USB Flash drives as its uses  wear levelling mechanism. So data leak can happen and their encryption also will not be implemented properly.
So there is no use in encrypting and creating hidden partition in usb flash drives, but people are blindly blaming even fips rated secure flash drives and praising veracrypt.
Don't they know this issue?

Adapting Hashcat's mul_mod for Multiplication mod N,6,1bhpa9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1bhpa9c/adapting_hashcats_mul_mod_for_multiplication_mod_n/,3,2024-03-18 07:15:57,"Hello! I am trying to perform some EC arithmetic on the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) curve. 

Specifically, I am having trouble performing a modular multiplication using [Hashcat‚Äôs OpenCL implementation mul_mod](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/fafb277e0736a45775fbcadc1ca5caf0db07a308/OpenCL/inc_ecc_secp256k1.cl#L593) function.

The function as-written is for performing modular multiplication `mod P`, but I am needing to perform modular multiplication `mod N`. I previously tried to modify the function to use the lib‚Äôs `SECP256K1_N*` values, but was not getting the proper result. 

I noticed that the function uses an optimized algorithm from [Modular Multiplication using special prime moduli](http://www.isys.uni-klu.ac.at/PDF/2001-0126-MT.pdf) (p.354 or p.9 in that document), and as such uses a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù from the curve (omega: `0x3d1`) related to the curve‚Äôs P value in the internal calculations. 

Is there a straight-forward way to alter this function to perform multiplication `mod N`? Or, is this specific implementation not compatible due to the ‚Äúspecial moduli‚Äù? If not compatible, can someone help point me in the right direction of an OpenCL compatible mul_mod secp256k1 implementation?"

Schneier, Ferguson, Singh, Paar etc.) but they only seem to edge the topic of padding oracles in one sentence while going into depth into CBC or similar.

On top of that, could you guys maybe enlighten me. Is there a reason, why this topic is usually not worthy for an own sub-chapter? Is it a trivial thing or is it just too vague?

Why padding oracles? I am interested in having some literal content, other than the same explanations on the internet. Don't get me wrong, they are good and helpful, but while learning for my crypto exam, I often realized, that I want to go the extra mile.

Regarding the book. I would like for it to be a general book, which also contains knowledge about encryption, authentication, netsec, and IPSEC/DNS(SEC) if possible.

motivation: bank releases a signed document about your monthly transactions. you want to show it to someone, but redact certain fields.

kinda something like this:

bank has a signing key, the public key of it is PUB

the bank signs a document m that is a series of submessages m_1 ... m_n. the bank also publishes S signature.

then i can redact any of the messages, and construct, e.g:

m_1, redacted(m_2), m_3, ..., and a modified S'

anyone with S' and PUB can verify the redacted signature against the redacted m.

it is okay if S' has a totally different format than S.

it should be clear and verifiable which parts are redacted and which parts are original.

the parts must still be linked together. so individually signing parts is not enough.

however, it should not be feasible to figure out any redacted elements, even with brute force. this is important, because m_i can be of a small set, like birth year, or can be guessable, like a suspected recipient bank account number."

They still only sign key exchange with P-256 (not a PQ scheme), which also isn't a curve I like. They also assume AES-CTR is ""quantum secure"" - which I guess gets reduced to ~127bit security with Grovers.

Overall nice to see PQ primitives used at this scale.

I have a question about data encoding for various FHE schemes. 

I've read the original CKKS paper, and as I understand, with CKKS, we have to use canonical embedding encoding procedures to encode our data into polynomials from Rq, which means that with degree-N polynomials, we can encode at most N/2 numbers. 

I have a couple of questions
 Are there other encoding schemes for CKKS with better encoding efficiency? 
What encoding schemes are used by BGV and/or BFV? What is their efficiency? 
What other encoding schemes exist, and what schemes use them? 

Thank you!"
Valid use of scrypt for AES256?,5,1b1i1ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1b1i1ml/valid_use_of_scrypt_for_aes256/,2,2024-02-27 11:47:08,"I'm working on a [database project](https://github.com/nice-switch/odv-db) with Python and I'm using [scrypt](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/protocol/kdf.html) to generate two hashes derived from a password with salt.

One for comparison/authorisation and the second is a key for encrypted data.

Is this a safe use-case?

I personally think so due to the fact the only way you'll get the second hash is if you brute-force the first one which would ultimately mean they have your password.

At the moment I just wanna be safe, thank you for your advice!

Specifically, I have set of parties (which must be scalable to more than two!) who each will possess a share of a mutually-unknown secret key which cannot be revealed safely. Instead, I need to reveal the result of hashing the key XORed with some extra data; indeed, the entire point of the multi-party computation is to ensure that as long as there's one non-colluding party, the key cannot be derived. The most obvious approach seems be to use fully homomorphic encryption, but that is (usually?) a symmetric system where whatever key which can decrypts the output data could also decrypt the input, which must remain secret.

I have some design leeway, and while I prefer a low-communication solution, I might instead be able to use a protocol like MP-SPDZ's `tinier` FKOS15 implementation over a bitsliced boolean circuit -- except that I've tried three different circuits and can't get a test vector to work in any of them. (That part might just be because I suck. Pointers appreciated.)

I'm also tantalized by the idea that the fact that the compression function is itself constructed entirely from simple boolean operations (AND, XOR, NOT, and rotate right) might mean that it's in the set of functions which can be efficiently handled by the method described in [Secure Computation on the Web: Computing without Simultaneous Interaction](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/157.pdf), but I have no idea if I'm barking up a sensible tree there.

if chacha20 keys are guaranteed to be random will that satisfy the no-nonce-reuse rule?,2,1anvof9,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1anvof9/if_chacha20_keys_are_guaranteed_to_be_random_will/,2,2024-02-10 19:07:34,"cross-positing from [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39321117):

currently playing around with X25519/chacha20  (and its AEAD counterpart chacha20poly1305) to do some PGP-esque  encryption stuffs [here](https://github.com/seanwatters/rgp/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L125).

based on my understanding of stream ciphers, ""nonce  reuse"" refers more specifically to ""nonce reuse with a given key, for  different plaintexts.""

basically the thing that i'm trying to  evaluate is whether there is any risk to ""reusing"" a single nonce with a  bunch of keys that are guaranteed to be random.

the process for encryption is as follows:

1. Generate one-time and ephemeral components
    - nonce      
    - one-time content key      
    - ephemeral private key      
    - one-time public key 
2. Sign plaintext to generate content signature
3. Encrypt plaintext and content signature with one-time content key
4. Encrypt one-time content key for all recipients
    - Generate shared secret with recipient public key and ephemeral private key
    - Encrypt one-time content key with shared secret

in the current setup the ""content key"" (think PGP session key) is always randomly generated, and the Diffie-Hellman shared secrets‚Äîused to encrypt the ""content key"" for each recipient‚Äîare created with an ephemeral/throw-away private key that's also randomly generated (and if you have a duplicated public key in your recipient set, it's still same-key-for-same-nonce-for-same-plaintext so no violation).

additionally, if there was somehow an overlap on a recipient's DH shared secret and the content key (statistically very low likelihood) i'm not sure that there is any additional vulnerability, or way to analyze without having already either gotten the content key or the shared secret, and in either of those cases you're already in.

NOTE: this whole thing is mostly just about saving storage space; ideally just wouldn't have to store an additional 24 bytes per recipient. with benchmarking, the time overhead of generating a nonce for each recipient is negligible."

For ECDSA curves, you can recover the public key from a signature too. But additionally, you can use that public key for Diffie-Hellman. I.e. you can encrypt a message for a specific and passive party (without a handshake).

Can the key-pair for FALCON also be used for Diffie Hellman to access this property ECDSA signatures have?"

I'm working on a file hosting service (think s3) one of which's goals is storage deduplixation between clients. Files are identified by their hashes, and currently every client must re-upload the entire file to prove ownership. We're trying to move to a model where files aren't not re-uploaded using some kind of Proof of Retrievability.

Ideas we've come up with:
1. Generate a secret per file at first upload time, and generate an HMAC using that secret and file. Store secret and HMAC. Provide client with secret at upload time to allow them to generate the HMAC and present it as PoR.
2. Classic merkle tree.
3. Generate hash list (basically merkle tree leaf nodes but no tree) and store with file. Request entire hash list as a PoR from client.

Our security team shot down 1 since they thought a shared secret (even though it's on a per file basis) between clients is bad. We decided against 2 because it's too much of a burden on our clients. We're implementing 3, but tbh it just doesn't sit right with me.

Do any of you have thoughts on some kind of alternative PoR that has the ease of use of the hash list or HMAC, but allows each challenge to be unique? Additionally, we ruled server side spot checks or dynamic HMAC secrets since it's too expensive to read from storage.

I came here because I am interested in ZK-proofs, especially non-standard uses. They're nice for L2s in blockchains, but ZK-proofs should have so many other benefits. My real interest is in pushing the limits of what we can do with them, such as using it for fuzzy data (ZK biometric proofs) and maybe even geometric ZK-proofs which could be used to prove flight paths without giving them away. 

Both of those options I'm sure would be quite computationally complex. I guess here's a simple version for flight paths: can we prove that two lines never intersect without giving away what those two lines are? I guess that's the very simplest geometric ZK-proof."

The answer I usually get is that it's much easier to find a solution when the operations are out of group.  I've never seen though the effort to prove to me entirely why.

This example public key algorithm is an out of group RSA variant and thus far does not have any solution that breaks it.

Generate 4 primes not equal (a, b, p, q)

n = p \* q

m = a \* b

t = ((a - 1) \* (b - 1) \* (p - 1) \* (q - 1)

pk = random integer such that GCD of integer and t = 1.

sk = modular inverse of (pk, t)

if n < m swap n and m

Encryption and decryption are achieved with 2 exponentiations.  Encryption m first then n, decryption, n first then m.  Signing and verification are achieved similarly to RSA signing modulus order (m, n) verification modulus order (n, m).

What makes this a good or bad public key algorithm?

I'm currently playing with my [Tkey](https://tillitis.se/products/tkey/), which for our purposes is basically an HSM. Among other things, I would like to use it to sign huge multi-gigabyte files. Unfortunately my beloved TKey has less-than-lovely specs:

- A very slow RV32I CPU running at 18MHz).
- An even slower 62.5K bauds serial connection.

Hashing my 4GiB file on the TKey would take forever, and streaming it would take even longer. What am I gonna do?

## The boring solution

Well duh, don't sign the file, sign a hash of the file instead. And if that's not good enough there's Ed25519ph (Pre-Hash) that can do the job for you, RFC approved and all. There's even [direct support for it in Monocypher](https://monocypher.org/manual/ed25519), just use that and your tiny TKey won't have to hash the whole file.

## The clever solution

No no no, that's not good enough. I want a _pure_ Ed25519 signature, of the _entire_ file. When there's a will, there's a way, so let's try to be clever and [hope for the best](https://monocypher.org/quality-assurance/disclosures).

Hem.

First, a recap of Ed25519. Starting from a secret key `sk` (a random 32 byte number) and a message `M`, the whole signature thing goes like this:

    t1 = SHA-512(sk)[ 0..31]
    t2 = SHA-512(sk)[31..63]
    a  = trim_scalar(t1)         // Secret key
    A  = [a]B                    // Public key
    r  = SHA_512(t2 || M) % l    // Secret nonce (l == curve order)
    R  = [r]B                    // Public nonce
    h  = SHA_512(R || A || M)
    s  = (h*a) + r
    -> R || s

As for signature verification:

    assert(A is on the curve)
    assert(R is on the curve)
    assert(s < l)
    h = SHA_512(R || A || M)
    assert([8*s]B == [8*h]A + [8]R)

The first problem with Ed25519, is how signing requires _two_ passes over the file. My TKey's puny 128Kib won't hold my 4GiB file, so not only do I need to hash it twice, I need to _stream_ it twice. But you'll notice that the first hash has one purpose and one purpose only: deterministically generate a random nonce between 0 and the curve order. The main reason for the determinism is to avoid the dreaded ECDSA nonce reuse, and be immune to bad RNG. The TKey has a good RNG, so let's rely on that:

    t2 = random(32 bytes)
    r  = SHA-512(t2) % l

_(Note that I don't trust my TKey to generate perfectly unbiased random bytes, so I use a hash to smooth out any irregularity.)_

Now I only need one pass:

    h = SHA_512(R || A || M)

Note how this is derived from public information only. It has to be, since that's the hash used for verification down the line. Which means I can compute it on my host laptop, which got gigabytes of memory and gigahertz of speed. How about doing just that?

    TKey:
        r = SHA-512(32-random-bytes) % l  // Secret nonce
        R = [r]B                          // public nonce
        -> r

    Laptop:
        h = SHA-512(R || A || M)
        -> h

    TKey:
        t1 = SHA-512(sk)[0..31]
        a  = trim_scalar(t1)              // Secret key
        s  = (h*a) + r
        -> s

    Laptop:
        signature = R || s
        assert(signature is valid)

So it looks like it works, right? Well‚Ä¶

## Is it secure?

It clearly is secure against eavesdropping, because only public information ever goes to the wire (except when you sign private files, but that's out of scope). Potentially more worrying is a compromised client or full blown MitM. My TKey is supposed to act as an HSM, so I need to guarantee it won't leak its secrets even if I get ransomwared by the NSA and KGB combined.

Note here that we have exactly three pieces of private information inside the TKey:

- __sk:__ the Ed25519 secret key.
- __a:__ the actual secret key (enough to forge messages).
- __r:__ the secret nonce.

The TKey outputs 2 pieces of information we could use to trigger a leak:

    R = [r]B
    s  = (h*a) + r

That is, the signature itself. Which is okay as long as `h` is legitimate, but a compromised client would actually have full control over `h`. So what if we replace `h` by some malicious value?

    s = (0*a) + r = r
    s = (1*a) + r = r+a

In the first case we leaked the secret nonce r. Which would be catastrophic if we could trick the TKey into reusing that nonce, but making sure the TKey uses each nonce for at most one signature is easy. I'm more worried about the second case. Sure, if we have only one it is quite clear we cannot disentangle `r` and `a` from just knowing `s`. But what if we try this several times?

    s1 = r1+a
    s2 = r2+a
    s2 - s1 = r2 - r1
    ...

You get the idea. I _think_ this kind of shenanigan is not enough to recover information about `a` (because of the similarity with stream ciphers), but I'm still afraid I might be missing something.

Hence my question: __is my scheme actually secure, or is there a way to get secrets out of my TKey from a compromised laptop?__"

I understand the basics of the purpose of a rainbow table and how a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-2) works and which properties it has.

I keep stumbling over the vague description of the required reduction function. My understanding about rainbow tables so far has been:

&#x200B;

* I have a list of many possible passwords (P)
* For each of these passwords p from P, I first calculate the hash value `h(p)` and then reduce it using a reduction function r. The result is a chain of length 1. This can be repeated many times to get longer chains
* The result of a chain of length 1 for the first password in my list is: `r(h(p_1))`
* The reduction function is usually chosen in such a way that it maps a relatively ""long"" hash value to a value that corresponds to the domain of the original password list P. So `|h(something)| > |r(something)|` and `|r|^character_set` is approximately as large in bits as the number of passwords in P, right?

So far so good. Now, however, this value r is hashed again at some time in order to be able to generate longer chains.

If I assume that the hash function h is a one-way function, I don't understand what information is gained here. If I hash a value y that is only minimally different from value x, the resulting hash value for cryptographic hash functions changes by 50% on average (avalance effect). So how can I gain any additional information from `h(r(...))`?

I can¬¥t see the benefit from a rainbow table since i don¬¥t get how a further hashing of a somewhat arbitrary reduced previous hash gives me any advantage since any input to a hash function that is different than the original will give me something completely different what looks like random-ish."

1. As an example, if given a 256 bit hash function, I assume that there is a 1-1 mapping of all 256 bit inputs to different 256 bit hash functions.
2. For inputs longer than 256 bits, the hash value of all possible inputs of the same length provides a uniform distribution over the 256 bit hash space.

Now I know it is not practical to brute force test these assumptions. Are these true? and if so, is there a fundamental property of hash functions that forces this?

Universal hashing misunderstood?,16,18leu5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/18leu5m/universal_hashing_misunderstood/,38,2023-12-18 11:52:39,"As a developer of a hash function - \`komihash\`, a fast non-cryptographic hash, I was thinking about figuring out how to prove that it is ""universal"". But I've stumbled upon some sort of a block in undestanding...

Universal hash function's collision estimate is commonly defined as N/M, where N is the number of unique keys, and M is the capacity of a data structure (or hash output, if a hash-map is used). For example, in this lecture: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect1004.pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect1004.pdf) or on Wikipedia, but there it's much harder to read.

However, as I know from practice, collision estimate for all modern hash functions, from non-cryptographic xxHash to cryptographic SHA and Blake is (N\^2)/M/2. This can be seen in SMHasher tests.

So, the question is - what an ""acceptable"" universality proof should prove - N/M or (N\^2)/M/2? N/M can probably be seen in CRC32 or some linear mappings, but these are not considered ""state-of-the-art"" hashes, and I can't prove this for \`komihash\`. Proving the latter can probably be done via birthday paradox and correlation reasoning as \`komihash\` is basically a pseudo-random permutation with validated high-quality PRNG performance.

EDIT: it was my misunderstanding - N/M relates to pair-wise collisions. While (N\^2)/M/2 is set's total collisions estimate, unrelated to isolated pair-wise collisions, and is not defined in ""universal hashing"".

EDIT2:  I've just found an answer myself. If a data structure is filled with values from S iteratively, one by one value, and each addition causes N0/M collisions on average, where N0 is the current number of values in a data structure, then the integral of the number of collisions from 0 to N0 is N0\^2/M/2, for ""universal hash function"", and it cannot be anything else."

Help me to find right Cryptography course for myself,5,18fzvw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/18fzvw8/help_me_to_find_right_cryptography_course_for/,12,2023-12-11 11:37:41,"Hello,

I'm from IT background but I know very little about cryptography.

&#x200B;

Issue: I'm new to Cryptography. I've been trying to learn cryptography for quite a long time. I joined many courses so far from University to paid courses, the issue with many of these courses is

&#x200B;

The way they teach is stuck on single Powerpoint slide and speak the whole lecture which is very boring, non interactive. The professor or teacher in other courses assumes the student knows it all and skip definition of many things.

&#x200B;

The solution I'm looking for is :

Is there any course out there (from verified sourse not any random youtube video) that teaches cryptography from the scratch, just for beginner, at a very basic level, and teach in an interactive manner like using animation.

&#x200B;

**\[ Update \]**

I couldn't understand the long courses (I attended many of them) which aimed at beginners but they explained cryptography terminologies in brief in just 1 sentence and move on..

Then explain different encryption without explaining in detail what the basics are and also without explaining, the terminologies in detail for ex: I attended a few courses that just went off my head.

&#x200B;

So I decided to attend the Introductory course but I'm yet to find the one I'm looking for, I'm sure I'll get that. I prefer paid course as they tend to add value and I'm open to attending more than one (if you've any suggestions).

&#x200B;

FYI: At present, I don't want to go for practical things as I first want to understand the very basics, literally elementary level basics (to go up to beginner level) so that I can understand. Once, I found a course that aimed to children but it was too short and ended in 7 mins.

&#x200B;

I just want to learn the very basics in very easy to digest manner like:

history of cryptography and 

followed by different ways of cryptography, 

how it's used (for ex different types of encryption) in a very easy language and with interactivity as I mentioned earlier.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone know what I'm looking for? Thank you in advance üôÇ"

Does my research proposal make sense?,11,18dztif,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/18dztif/does_my_research_proposal_make_sense/,5,2023-12-08 17:30:39,"Hello, I'm seeking opinions for my PhD research proposal related to cryptography and type theory. My idea is to create a framework in Agda (a proof assistant) for universal composability proofs. This is largely motivated by the fact that most cryptographic proofs aren't rigourous and is on paper. If there is a framework for mechanizing UC proofs then we can guarantee that the proofs are actually correct with a lot less effort, and also ideally lower the entry for people who want to formally proofs their protocols are secure.

My university happens to have a lot of experts in formalizing pi calculus, so my plan is to:
1. Formalize ""interactive polynomial time turing machines"" with pi calculus in Agda
2. Make some helper lemmas and functions to help with actually doing UC proofs
3. ???
4. Profit 
5. Maybe try to actually use it by translating some proofs from paper to Agda, like the OPAQUE proof

My questions are:
1. Are there communities online that are experts in universal composability proofs? It would help if there's a Zulip / Discord / Slack group where I can ask more in-depth questions.
2. I know there are people in University of Boston who are also trying to mechanize UC proofs with EasyCrypt. That said I haven't tried EasyCrypt at all, so I don't actually know how it works. They said they needed to create a DSL specifically to reduce boilerplate code, so I'm guessing EasyCrypt's expressiveness isn't that good and perhaps a more expressive proof assistant like Agda would be a better choice. Does it make sense to try to mechanize UC proofs in Agda when there are already people doing this with EasyCrypt? 
3. Somewhat related to (2), but if anyone here knows EasyCrypt would you mind sharing your experience using EasyCrypt to formalize cryptographic proofs? How difficult would you say it would be to use EasyCrypt to model more abstract stuff like simulation based proofs?"

Using hash generated from other hashes as key?,6,187zbz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/187zbz6/using_hash_generated_from_other_hashes_as_key/,3,2023-11-30 19:30:56,"Hi.

Right after going through introduction to cryptography, I'm putting it into practice, mainly to learn.

For instance, I wanted to try out cascading encryption.

I was using ascon and XChaCha20-Poly1305 (as an introduction to fast/lightweight algorithms).  The keys for both are generated just before use, from hashes, say, user password hash, combined with hash of something else.  I used argon2 to get the hashes (extracted the actual random thing from inside of what argon2 generated).  The two hashes are joined by addition, say, in python, hash1+password\_hash.  The result is hashed with ascon.hash with ascon-xof, to get a final hash, which is to be used as key

`key = ascon.hash(hash1 + password_hash, ""Ascon-Xof"", 64)`

Key is never saved anywhere. Neither is user password hash (or password). For hash1, either the actual hash, hash1, is saved or some random thing, from which hash1 is to be generated, is saved.

The question is about key generation. For each, ascon and xchachapoly, different hash1 are combined with the same user password hash, (say, ascon\_hash1 + phash, xcp\_hash1+phash), to generate different keys of required lengths.

Is generating key like this bad? How bad?

The question actually originated when I was about use an actual KDF, HKDF, and figured it is going to be pain in the moola if I use any more libraries. But if the above is stupid, I will use actual HKDF.

Ps. I'm still learning, the above is not for real world project but a prototype.

Rant: Not published? Not secure! (FHE edition),12,183ntd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/183ntd6/rant_not_published_not_secure_fhe_edition/,8,2023-11-25 10:46:30,"Like some of you I first heard about ZKSnarks in 2012 and was floored. It might have been first realized in 1985, but to see it practically explained and ready for implementation was mind blowing *(I mean, all cryptography is basically wizardry anyway!)*. I immediately jumped right behind it and followed everything about it. I was able to read the paper, understand some of it, and see the building consensus amongst researchers as to its efficacy. The open discussions were illuminating.

Around that same time I learned of the new applications of forward secrecy in communications protocols too, like OMEMO or Signal. Cryptography was killing it! Solving problems, saving lives, helping people through transparent research and open source application of number theory ‚Äì this is what makes it all worth it!

Then in 2018 I heard about some improvements in homomorphic encryption and immediately fell in love. It was basically promising the ability to perform computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. That‚Äôs huge! Of course everyone around me said *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just theory, there‚Äôs no way it will work in practice. It‚Äôs decades away, if ever‚Äù*, but it was open source, research was continuing transparently, and you could understand that even though there were differing approaches / schemes, everyone wanted it to work for the benefit of everyone and there was a lot of passion for it.

The recurring theme to the positive effect of these advancements in cryptography and applied cryptography that I'm talking about here were that they were made possible because of open, published research, and transparent, open source applications. We all know that while being open doesn‚Äôt guarantee something is secure, being closed kind of guarantees it can‚Äôt be.

This applies to all cryptography of course, but as FHE is just now starting to really explode, I feel it‚Äôs important for us to demand substantial evidence or peer-reviewed research of any FHE solutions. The complexity of FHE makes it challenging for non-experts to distinguish between legitimate advancements and fraudulent claims ‚Äì even for other cryptographers who aren‚Äôt studied in FHE ‚Äì  so we as a community need to speak out as we have done before with *‚Äúnot your keys? not your crypto.‚Äù* except now *‚Äúnot open? not secure‚Äù*. You don't need to be an expert in homormophic encryption to know that someone claiming ""*it works, but you have to trust me*"" or ""*watch this demo but we can't show you any code*"" isn't good enough.

Everyone here knows this and I'm preaching to the choir, but I feel like it can't be stated enough so I wanted to make this post. We really should demand tangible evidence supporting any claims made about FHE products or technologies, and we should demand they allow independent verification of their efficacy and security. The research behind it should also be made public and subject to peer review.

We all care about cryptography and the promises it holds for protecting and advancing communications and information and thus civilization as a whole ‚Äì that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all here ‚Äì but ""*Not published? Not secure! ""*"

JWT with associated data,6,17qod5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/17qod5e/jwt_with_associated_data/,2,2023-11-08 09:41:31,"Let's say you have to use JWT and have a JWT library that you trust. Now let's say you want to use additional data when verifying the JWT in a manner similar to an AEAD. This additional data should not be disclosed by the JWT. And this is not supported by your basic JWT library. How would you do that?

Encoding the associated data with [PAE](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/docs/01-Protocol-Versions/Common.md#authentication-padding) seems like a good first step. 

Then it's possible to include a hash of this encoded associated data to a ""aad"" field within jwt data (in the payload probably). Verification then comports two steps, first verify that the JWT is properly signed using the library, then verify the associated data hash in that JWT. But I dislike that we've now split our security verification in two steps that depend on each other, even if I can't find a way to exploit it at the moment. It feels error-prone.

It also discloses a hash on the associated data, which isn't desirable if it is composed of guessable information. This is fixed either by adding a nonce to the associated data (but now we also need a new ""aad-nonce"" field) or using a HMAC with a server secret instead of a regular hash for the ""aad"" field. Having a server secret goes against many uses of JWT so it's probably not a great idea.

If the JWT signature uses HMAC instead of RSA, then we can maybe include the associated data in the key. Something like: hmac_key = pbkdf(pae([associated_data] + [hmac_secret])). But that approach gives some amount of control over the HMAC secret which is the foundation of our security in this JWT scenario, which isn't great. And it's impossible if RSA is used.

So all in all it seems the best is to add two fields to the JWT:

* ""aad-nonce"" with a nonce
* ""aad"" with SHA384(PAE(associated_data))

followed by a two-step verification.

What do you think? Do you know of any library that proposes associated data natively with the JWT? Do you see any flaw in that design?

Looking for advice on building inline radio encryption solution,9,17dkmul,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/17dkmul/looking_for_advice_on_building_inline_radio/,4,2023-10-21 22:58:21,"I have recently decided to begin working on a radio project that I honestly have no idea where to start on. I currently have no real knowledge of programming, encryption, electronics, radio (beyond signal propagation fundamentals), or any other concepts and/or processes required to see this project through to final development of a functional product/prototype. I would also like to note that I am interested only in building this and NOT buying a commercially available device of comparable capability. This is primarily to ensure personal control over functionality and develop a fundamental understanding of all processes involved in the project.

The concept is an inline encryption/decryption device that is intended to be connected to a digital radio. On the transmitting end, it should take the voice transmission from the digital radio, encrypt it, and then transmit it over RF. The receiving end decrypts the transmission and forwards it to the connected radio. This is intended to allow the end user to dictate their own encryption methods for digital radio rather than relying on manufacturer encryption standards.

I would like to eventually expand this device's capabilities and make it able to send encrypted text and other data over radio as well. I would like it to be capable of functioning as a standalone device when transmitting text, but must require connection to a radio to transmit voice.

Unfortunately, I do not even have limited knowledge to start with. I know nothing of the concepts or skillsets required to begin creating such hardware and am seeking advice or even assistance on where to start. I may even be willing to make the final product open-source or seek partners/codevelopers in the development process.

Please understand I am only seeking advice and assistance regarding tackling this project. I am not interested in the opinions of Sad Hams who will argue ""legality"" of encrypted signals on amateur radio frequencies. This is not intended to be used on amateur radio frequencies.

Any help will be greatly appreciated."

&#x200B;

I'm aware we work in a cyclic subgroup of curve25519 for obvious reasons, the curve is composite order, with groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, q, 2q, 4q, 8q.

&#x200B;

1, 2, 4 & 8 are obviously tiny and useless.

2q, 4q & 8q are not interesting as composite and can be attacked with PH.

&#x200B;

I think that the reason we clamp the key is to ensure we are always using a key that is a multiple of 8 so we always end up working in q.

&#x200B;

A few questions:

&#x200B;

1. If we always used the regular G as generator, we would always end up in q anyway right? (even without the key being a multiple of 8), so this only matters for ECDH, where maybe G is not the only point used for scalarmul?
2. does this mean that the actual valid private keys are literally always multiples of 8, i.e. 8, 16 ... 2\^252 - so all keys between 1 and 8 would yield the same public key? (appreciate in reality we use 32 byte keys, but hypothetically) if your private key was: \`\`\`0x0000000000000...1\`\`\` or \`\`\`0x0000000000000...7\`\`\` you'd get the same pub key after clamping + scalarmul, right?
3. If 2 is true I guess this is ok as q is really representing only 1/8th of the points on the curve?

I feel disappointed on not trusting more on my own work... I could be highly recognized by such results.

*Elligator is a way to hide a cryptographic key exchange using elliptic curves as random noise, devised by Daniel J. Bernstein, Mike Hamburg, Anna Krasnova, and Tanja Lange.*

I was wondering what kind of threat actor are we considering where Elligator matters. This was prompted after reading [How the Great Firewall of China Detects and Blocks Fully Encrypted Traffic](https://gfw.report/publications/usenixsecurity23/en/). What I've come to realise is that crude measures are taken for applications that do encryption - GFW doesn't have a DPI that's distinguishing poionts from random strings, it's instead trying to drop any communication that indicate likeliness of high-entropy throughput indicating encrypted streams.

Are there implementations of censors where they've implemented inspecting traffic and performing point distinguishability of strings for a putative handshake and not considering the traffic a concern if it is indistinguishable from random?"

Assuming having **hypothetical [NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_\(complexity\)) solver**, we could ask it ""for what cryptokey, deciphered prefix is not a noise"" - in theory being able to break not only e.g. RSA, but also symmetric ciphers ... the question is how to design more difficult cryptography requiring hypothetical PSPACE solver instead for such potential attack?

**[PSPACE-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE-complete)** are e.g. **SAT with added forall** general quantifier, many puzzles and **games** ... in theory we could make e.g. M2M authentication such a game.

Grad School & Isogeny-based crypto,10,168ixgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/168ixgr/grad_school_isogenybased_crypto/,3,2023-09-02 19:41:14,"I‚Äôm a pure math undergraduate in the US applying to grad school this semester (and starting my search perhaps a little late‚Ä¶ oops). I‚Äôm interested in mathematical cryptography, including the theoretical design of cryptosystems and the study of mathematical problems that are related to or ‚Äúone step removed‚Äù from cryptography, e.g., in algebraic number theory and algorithmic number theory. That said, there are basically no faculty working in cryptography at my university‚Äîhence my focus on pure math instead‚Äîand so I‚Äôm turning here for domain-specific advice.

I have a few questions, and would really appreciate any insight anyone in the field could give, even if only on one of the questions.

1. Does anyone have recommendations for programs and/or particular professors to look for? From my searching it seems that relatively few researchers in mathematical cryptography (in academia) are in the US, whereas I‚Äôve found many in Canada (Waterloo, mainly) and in Europe. There are a few I‚Äôve found in the US‚ÄîKirsten Eisentrager (Penn State), Katherine Stange (CU Boulder), some at USF and FAU as well, and some more junior faculty at Virginia Tech. Are there any other particularly notable programs I should consider besides these? (Or any of these I shouldn‚Äôt really consider?)

2. To what extent does the overall academic reputation of the grad school matter if my goal is to pursue a career in research? I know that in principle what matters is your research, but I‚Äôve also heard (more informally) that it can sometimes be difficult for hiring committees to completely ignore where someone did their graduate work, and that has made me (perhaps wrongly) a little wary of places like FSU and FAU. 

3. Would it be a bad/risky choice to go into isogeny-based crypto now, given the attack on SIDH from last year? Or is it still an active area of research that‚Äôs attracting funding?

Thanks very much for reading! And if anyone has any other advice/comments unrelated to these questions (or related to questions that I should have asked but didn‚Äôt), I would very much appreciate those as well."

What are the use cases for VRFs?,12,1609koo,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1609koo/what_are_the_use_cases_for_vrfs/,2,2023-08-24 13:11:28,"Just came across this RFC for VRFs - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9381.txt

At the outset, I thought, it's meant to reduce the over all TCB in a security protocol? For example, we can do the keyed mac verification using a public key and so don't have to establish the key for it. However this uses asymmetric key crypto and so doesn't quite into what I described above. Also the performance won't meet the symmetric key based protocol/computations. 

From the RFC -- ""A key application of the VRF is to provide privacy against offline
   dictionary attacks (also known as enumeration attacks) on data stored
   in a hash-based data structure.  In this application, a Prover holds
   the VRF secret key and uses the VRF hashing to construct a hash-based

Novel Hash Based PoW Key Exchange,6,15wrkas,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15wrkas/novel_hash_based_pow_key_exchange/,1,2023-08-20 19:12:39,"Hey everyone. Long time lurker and security buff with a hobbyist specialization in cryptography. To put it in perspective, I've studied secure coding and practiced proper implementation of cryptographic primitives (i.e., how to handle a password, various algorithms, salting hashes, CSPRNG vs PRNG, and things on that level). I've only just come up with this idea in the last couple days so please excuse a few potential errors. This is not a finished system. Also, all of this is written on mobile from memory.  Please let me know if I went off the wall somewhere and I'll review it.  I mainly want to get opinions and discuss my approach using hashing and PoW as a key exchange algorithm. 

With the goal of securing a connection (tunnel) from point A to point B, I have been developing a rough draft proof of concept that will allow both parties to mutually exchange a set of secrets as proofs of work. As with DH, this is susceptible to a MitM attack. It's important to note that this is designed to establish a mutual, genuine interest in the secure connection, but only guarantees the integrity of the connection. It will limitedly ensure confidentiality, but only if the first few handshakes aren't recorded and solved by a bad actor.  This means that a connection can be intercepted after the fact with no repercussions, but an attacker with logs of the entire exchange session will be able to solve the PoW and create a MitM-like scenario

The handshake works by forcing both parties to brute force the hashes of randomly generated values to arrive at unique proofs of work. They are effectively authenticating each other's interest in creating this session.  They share the completed proofs and, if valid, they continue brute forcing in segments until both secrets are complete. 

Each party generates a unique, random secret S and hashes N bytes of S before exchanging the result. Ideally this will include a random salt, integration of connection details into the hash, and timestamps.  The mutual challenges are passed if both parties return valid hashes of the (ideally modified) plaintext solutions. This repeats for all bytes in both secrets. As N increases, so does the computational cost of the handshake (256^N hashes max with 256^N / 2 being the average hashes needed to solve the proof for N-byte chunks). 

This process expends time and energy to make eavesdropping costly to an attacker. It also reinforces the relationship between points A and B since they are both performing work to support the connection.  A MitM would have to do twice the work to arrive at the same secrets. 

Even with full knowledge of the parameters, the attacker would need to perform the same brute force attacks as the legitimate parties. There is no way to coerce the secrets without solving the hashes. Again, I know anyone with knowledge of the full session can perform the same work (perhaps more easily) but the same potential exists with DH as well. If an attacker tries to do this across multiple sessions, they will be expending that much more energy to breach just one layer of security. This can be further enhanced by adding a static number of hashes to be done on the final step, and/or using a memory-hard hash function like scrypt. 

This is my first post and entirely on mobile so cut me a little slack lol. Thanks!"

Proof of human craft cryptographyc signature,4,15tr9a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15tr9a8/proof_of_human_craft_cryptographyc_signature/,5,2023-08-17 10:46:19,"Ignoring if something like this exists or  if it‚Äôs being developed, I was wondering about this idea:

A signature attached to an image (or other) file, that proofs that the image was created by human craft.

The signature should be able to verify that the image was created by a human considering how much work was done within some creation software using some verified hardware and how much intervention from other sources the image had (like copy from external source into the image).

Since my knowledge  about crypto is almost non existent, here is a rough and clumsy description: creation software (like krita) could have an add on that ‚Äúrecords‚Äú all movements within the software and hash it so it can be used to verify the  how the work was done. This signature should also consider a hardware key implemented within creation hardware like wacom in a way that the only way to fake the image using machines is to have a robotic arm trained to behave like a human and spend the time a human will take to create the image, holding a stylus and using a wacom tablet painting in krita in a way a human would.

Do you think it‚Äôs applicable? Can someone with a better understanding about crypto give me a more accurate description about how it could be accomplished from a technical point of view or point me where I could study about systems like this?"

Trouble detecting cyclic group order crossovers in SECP256K1,6,15c7nvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15c7nvu/trouble_detecting_cyclic_group_order_crossovers/,0,2023-07-28 15:04:43,"There's a problem in detecting whether the sum of public key addition has crossed the cyclic group order boundary

For this example, think of public keys **Pub** as private keys **Priv**, (private scalars), one-way converted to points on the elliptic curve.

**n** \- is the order of the group. Private keys can range from 1 (the generator point **G**) to **n‚àí1**.

**n‚àí1** is the maximum size (integer value) of a private key, and it is also the number of all non-trivial points available on the curve.

The order **n** itself produces the point at infinity **n ‚àó G = O**. Adding points further, just starts the curve over again.

As each public key has its own corresponding private key, that corresponding private key lies within certain ranges of powers of 2.

The order itself lies within: 2^(255) < **n** < 2^(256)

Suppose that we have a public key **Pub** that corresponds to the private key **Priv** whose range is known. Like: 2^(a) < **Priv** < 2^(b)

Before using a certain formula, we need to create 2 arrays

1. An array of 256 public keys. Each public key will represent a private key that will be powers of 2 ranging from 2^(0) = 1 (the generator point) to 2^(255)

2) Another array of 256 public keys, with each public key representing private key that contains: 1 + (1 over the power of 2 ranging from 2^(1) to 2^(255)  ). Note: B\[0\] is going to be 1 + 1 = 2. Like:

https://preview.redd.it/900rsg2xjqeb1.jpg?width=669&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc602453daa684fbd642d7b4079ea5af00a99d43

The formula allows us to do this:

Imagine we have in addition:

2^(a) < **Pub** < 2^(a+1)

2^(b) < **A\[b\]** < 2^(b+1)

If **a = b** then:

https://preview.redd.it/6boqk6cdyqeb1.jpg?width=298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3f2dbe22fc59cf9971b8a4bca5fe4b2e436a03d

If the **Pub+A\[b\]** hasn‚Äôt crossed the n boundary, the result should be 1 or 2. Otherwise, it has crossed the n boundary

If **a > b** then:

https://preview.redd.it/bd8hu61jyqeb1.jpg?width=824&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d47ae5febc2d94a2c2acd82154925d8b89520f7a

If **a < b** then:

Let's review specific examples (Had to use links for some images):

1. a = b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0EOb.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0EOb.jpg))

Let 567 be our unknown private key converted into the public key. 2^(9) < 567 < 2^(10)

Let 637 be a public key that we add. 2^(9) < 637 < 2^(10)

https://preview.redd.it/hrvx2tp9zqeb1.jpg?width=264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bec6b5f878268d91d41f7b2bc37e951f4cc58d6d

2) a > b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZupFE.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZupFE.jpg))

For example, we could add the number that is 1 power of 2 less than our public key. Our public key corresponds to 2^(9) < 567 < 2^(10), and we add the public key of 2^(8) < 325 < 2^(9)

https://preview.redd.it/v2phsoglzqeb1.jpg?width=348&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3a4ed1029bf4aafdd07e71531b75f84aaf91f17

3)  a < b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSHp8.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSHp8.jpg))

Let's add the number that is 1 power of 2 higher than our public key. Our public key corresponds to 2^(9) < 567 < 2^(10), and we add the public key of 2^(9) < 1058 < 2^(10)

https://preview.redd.it/w4nf0r1uzqeb1.jpg?width=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75772d24718e9bbf7ae87121f6b7cd115defc72f

Why is it important? ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/UhZIF.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UhZIF.jpg)) ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/xhX3e.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xhX3e.jpg))

Imagine if we have a curve of order of n = 33 151. 2^(15) < 33151 < 2^(16)We'd like to add 67. 2^(6) < 67 < 2^(7). However, if the addition result of 2 public keys is bigger than the order of the elliptic curve, the count starts again. We could have our original private key to be **n ‚àí 1 = 33150**. Hence, **33150 + 67 => 33217 ‚àí 33151 = 66**

Let's apply the formula. In other settings:

https://preview.redd.it/9xfd0dti0reb1.jpg?width=437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d019c0d64c00cc7b2f7308ff88d512f635b7bfbe

However, in settings of our elliptic curve, 33150 + 67 becomes 66

https://preview.redd.it/rsuj216p0reb1.jpg?width=441&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4ac3cfbea0a6a47454765951103c49f3613e0e5

We didn't get an expected result, and hence we detected a cyclic group crossover.

But in practice it doesn't work. I've been experimenting with SECP256K1 additions. For example, if we take **n ‚àí 1** as our original private key converted to public key then:

When **(n ‚àí 1) + 3** we'd get a public key of **2G**.

https://preview.redd.it/nvk2lf5r2reb1.jpg?width=206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ad15b5f23f486fa582e712cb32874eebbbeecd6

Have no idea why.

In other words, why does the method work with decimal (normal) arithmetic, but with ECC additions, it doesn't? Is there any way to fix it?

https://www.plonk.cafe/t/understanding-plonk/67/2

By maximal degree, I assume he means that the opening time depends on the size of the Reference String - the tuple size depends on the highest degree of the polynomial you want to commit. 

I understand the KZG commitment scheme & it's opening but I couldn't figure out why opening time would depend on this.

Lets design a provably collision-free hash function.,5,14rgual,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/14rgual/lets_design_a_provably_collisionfree_hash_function/,21,2023-07-05 12:09:55,"The pigeonhole principle dictates that any collision-free hash function will produce an output digest whose length in bits is equal to the length of the input message.  Whatever function we implement, H(M), will be a bijection, and therefore any output digest `D=H(M)` will uniquely determine its paired input M.   

The properties of our H() which we desire are security, arbitrary input length, and a good avalanche effect.  Security means it is prohibitive for an attacker to surmise the message M, given its digest.  Avalanche effect means any small change in M results in a catastrophic amount of change in the bits of the digest.   Finally, arbitrary input length means that the length of M determines the output length -- in our case, exactly so.   

The uses of such a hash function are numerous :

+ You run a company that issues prepaid cards of some kind or another. Every card must have a unique access ID number, but consecutive access IDs give no indication of what IDs could occur in the future.  The IDs should be unpredictable even if many hostile customers horde thousands of cards and collude with each other.

+ You run a website with user-uploaded content.  You must automate the file names in your database of uploaded files, but in such a way that all filenames are unique.  You might desire the next file names are consecutively *unpredictable*  , to avoid directory crawling or other abuses of your system.

+ You need a substitution table for largeish words.  A bijection function is mathematically equivalent to a substitution table over words. If your word size is 32 bits, a substitution table would be a file of 16GB. Worse, if you have a word size of 64 bits, the table could never be stored on earth. Instead, you can use your collision-free H() to calculate this table ""on-the-fly"", on a word-for-word basis, without the need for storing the entire table.  You simply input your word into the function and it calculates the ""substitute"" word forwards. 

It may come as surprise that off-the-shelf cryptographic hash functions offer no guarantee of resistance to collisions. In many contemporary algorithms, it is merely anecdotal that no collisions have ever been found.  In contrast, the collision function described here is *provably collision free.* However it will utilize some famous hash functions internally. 

For brevity, we will denote the hash function CFHF(M), operating on input message M.   CFHF is best described for very long M first, and then modified to its shorter versions, which are significantly more complex. We will impose a simplifying constraint, that M must come in specific whole number of bytes. So CFHF has arbitrary input length, provided the input length is a multiple of 8 bits.   A final constraint is imposed that the smallest input length is 16 bits. Generally the input size is unbounded above.


# Large M

For larger M exceeding 64 bytes,  CFHF is mostly trivial.  We remove the leading 512 bits of M and set it aside.  The remaining portion is concatenated with a secret key , K.   This concatenated string is taken through a known hash function that outputs 512 bits.      The output of the hash is XOR'd against the leading bits of M set aside from earlier, and then slapped onto the end of the output block.    The remaining portion in the input (after the leading) is a copy , unmodified, at the beginning of the output block. 

The above procedure repeats recursively in several rounds, eventually where the final output block is the digest of CFHF().    

This large M case is shown in the following diagram over one round : 

https://i.imgur.com/thC2Qri.png

The corresponding pseudocode 

	-------------------------------
	|| ; concatenation operator
	M  ; message 
	""Mn"" ; denotes the nth iteration of M. Same length as M.  
	K  ; secret key .  the zero byte if not desired. 
	Hs() ;   SHA512 , WHIRLPOOL or similar. 
	rounds <-- 6  ;  (discuss?)
	for n <-- 1 .. rounds : 
		V <-- first 512 bits of Mn
		R <-- trailing bits of Mn after 512. 
		T <-- Hs(  R||K ) 
		Mn <-- R || (T xor V)  
	D <-- Mn
	Output D
	-------------------------------

While SHA512 is chosen here, any can be used (WHIRLPOOL, Skein, etc).

# Collision free? 

A heuristic proof that CFHF is free of collisions is to run the following algorithm on many (message,digest) pairs produced by CFHF.  The following pseudocode will recover M exactly given only its output digest, D.   

Note this procedure assumes the length of M exceeds 65 bytes.

    ------pseudocode of inverse function of CFHF()----
	|| ; concatenation operator
	D ; digest from CFHF above. 
	""Dn"" ; denotes the nth iteration of D. Same length as D.  
	K  ; secret key matches CFHF above.  
	Hs() ;   SHA512 , WHIRLPOOL or similar. 
	rounds <-- 6  ; (discuss?) 
	for n <-- 1 .. rounds : 
		V <-- trailing 512 bits of Dn
		R <-- leading bits of Dn not containing V 
		T <-- Hs(  R||K ) 
		Dn <-- (T xor V) || R 
	M <-- Dn
	Output M
    -------------------------------

Since M is always exactly recoverable starting from a digest alone, we argue (heuristically) that  the hash function must be a bijection.  Bijections are not merely collision *resistant* -- they are by definition free of collisions entirely. 

We turn to the discussion of whether CFHF really is collision free but in the mathematical sense.   We note that if SHA512() is chosen for Hs() , that there is no guarantee of collision resistance.  

Indeed, it must be the fact that collisions will occur in T, as the secret K key was concatenated to R.   It turns out this does not matter.  To prove this to the reader,  simply substitute a static T in the above algorithms. Substituting a constant T would correspond to maximal collisions in Hs(). Literally all inputs to Hs() collide.   Notice that M is still fully recoverable from D.   

Thus we conclude that  CFHF is still collision-free,  even when Hs() is not.


# Medium M

A medium length M is  17 bytes up to 64 bytes in length.  This special case is required as the chopping of the leading 512 bits leaves nothing left in the trailing section.   Given that the key K is still concatenated, we still implement SHA512, but then use MD6 to ""compress"" the digest.     Now instead of chopping 512 bits on a leading section, we chop 128 bits instead.  

A diagram of one round is shown here :

https://i.imgur.com/FHgp6Xg.png


# Small M 

As before,  the procedure of chopping off 128 leading bits will degenerate when the entire input message is less than 128 bits.   Some other procedure must be used.  CFHF() becomes most complex in this regime of inputs, and a block cipher is recruited in one of the steps.    Instead of chopping off a fixed-length leading section,  we now partition M into two left and right halves of equal length. This is always possible since M's length is constrained to multiples of 8 bits, and has an even length.

The diagram for one round is shown below :

https://i.imgur.com/2Pz2qSW.png

Some brief words on the decision to include a block cipher here.  It was required that the trailing bytes undergo a compression function.  The computer science literature is saturated with variations of how to 'hash' a larger string to a smaller one, due mostly to an abstract data structure called a *lookup hash table.* Those procedures were serious candidates here, as in this regime we may have M messages which are only a handful of 6 to 10 bytes or so.    However, those procedures are woefully insecure in the cryptographic sense.  

We opted instead for a different approach. This proceeds by first expanding the trailing bits to a 128bit block, via MD6.  This block is then subjected to a block cipher and then literally truncated by taking the first j bits and discarding the tail.  The reader may note that this procedure is technically implementing (what could be called) an arbitrary-length *compression function.*  For tiny M of 2 bytes, a block cipher is overkill. But this is the price paid for generality. 


# Implementation 

Constraints are imposed on CFHF() for simplicity. Input message must be in bytes, and the smallest message allowed is 2 bytes.  As far as the question as to how many rounds are suggested, the answer would nominally be six rounds.   Technically the number of rounds required is a convoluted function on the length of M.  These complications are simply academic.  A simple, straight answer is sufficient : use six rounds.    


# Weaknesses

For any designed hash function,  the desired avalanche effect has that if a single bit is changed in M, then (roughly) 50% of the bits change in the output digest. 

CFHF  exhibits a ""weak"" avalanche effect for extremely long M.  The reader may have noticed that if M is longer than say,  1600 bits,   then if a single bit is changed in M, the number of bits that change in the digest is maximally 512 bits.  Their location may even be identifiable in the digest.  This number then remains flat for M's longer than 1600.  

It may be that increasing the number of rounds heals this weakness.  It is not clear whether this is true in practice, and this space is ripe for research."

If you have 64 bits of address in a 256 bit field, would it not make sense to use an offset unique to each key?  That way, nobody uses the exact same set of indicies and multi-target resistance is improved by some measurabe amount. 

I may be completely incorrect, and I left out the levels and different address types for simplicity.

PASS uses GPG so I thought I would do something different and use AGE. Turns out that AGE does not do signing, so I was looking into if signing is necessary.

And I came across this article: https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/age-authentication/

After reading this my understanding is that signing is probably necessary if you are going to backup your secrets file to a cloud provider. Because otherwise they could just completely replace your file and you would never know.

The article also talks about something called **signcryption** and mentions how no popular tool does it. The author claims this is necessary because combining signing and encryption is hard.

> If you encrypt and then sign, an attacker can strip your signature, replace it with their own, and make it look like they encrypted the file even if they don't actually know the contents.

> If you sign and then encrypt, the recipient can decrypt the file, keep your signature, and encrypt it to a different recipient, making it look like you intended to send the file to them.

I am not really sure I understand the above statements because this should be applicable to GPG also right? Does GPG have the above problems?

Can I simply use AGE and maybe another signing tool like SIGNIFY to do what I want as an alternative to GPG?"

Novel (?) hash-based encryption algorithm (not signatures),2,1471ykt,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1471ykt/novel_hashbased_encryption_algorithm_not/,22,2023-06-11 13:54:05,"I implemented a custom encryption algorithm, encrypt-gib ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibgib/encrypt-gib), [github](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib)), and am looking for feedback (beyond don't create custom encryption algorithms). It is entirely open source, the existing readme explains the basic algorithm, and I am currently working on improving documentation that explains the stronger version (to help mitigate against short-circuit brute force attacks). I would be thrilled to give more info and answer questions, including my opinions on the nuances of the implementation.

After many hours of searching patents, the approach is novel AFAICT, though I have been able to find one existing patent, [""Message encryption using a hash function"", 1993, Kaufman & Perlman, DEC](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5483598A/en), that uses recursive hashing for dynamic creation of 1-time pads. There are key differences, let alone the lack of parameterization and configurability in the patent. Most of these differences rely on the knee-jerk reaction that the algorithm is ""inefficient"" as it operates at the hex level (i.e. not binary), when IMO the definition of ""efficiency"" always depends on the use case. My particular use case is to minimize complexity to be friendlier to our emerging DLT infrastructure and the future of smart contracts (though it's not directly related to cryptocurrency!). Also I offer it as an alternative to existing post quantum approaches for diversification, though of course that would require cryptanalysis beyond my current abilities. At the very least, it should be trivial fun for people who enjoy examining algorithms.

As for some of the other requirements before posting, I have certainly been aware of Kerckhoffs' principle for decades. Schneier's Law is newer to me but seems I imagine to be born of practicality with moderating forums above all else. I am not saying my system is unbreakable - far from it. That's why I'm looking for constructive external feedback, in good faith and friendly, from those with more cryptanalysis experience than me, including help pointing me to prior art.

## algorithm tl;dr

The [encrypt-gib readme](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/main/README.md) has a better walkthrough, but the fundamental idea is that instead of working at the binary level we work at the hex level. We encode the plaintext into hex, and then we use mostly recursive hashing to create ""JIT alphabets"" (similar to on-demand 1-time pads) *and substitute the character with its corresponding index into its alphabet.*

## example output

## weakest stream cipher

Here is an example of the weakest form that enciphers character by character.

With the encrypt-gib repo cloned and using node v20 (v19+ required b/c I use `globalThis` for easy isomorphic Web Crypto API usage):

    node . --encrypt --data-string=""foo"" --output-path=""./bar"" --strength=""weaker""

So `""foo""` is the plaintext, this will write to a file called `""./bar.encrypt-gib""` and `""weaker""` specifies a relatively arbitrary set of weaker parameters. Using the password of ""bar"", this produces the output in `bar.encrypt-gib`:
    {""encryptedData"":""3,2,8,16,89,9"",""initialRecursions"":1000,""recursionsPerHash"":2,""salt"":""3dcf8b601d59509f5608323d00d5077929a70544e17f9a5fb47cd7093b145704"",""saltStrategy"":""initialAppend"",""hashAlgorithm"":""SHA-256"",""encryptedDataDelimiter"":"",""}

_Note that it first hex encodes the plaintext, which is why there are more numbers in the ciphertext than characters in the plaintext._

## stronger multipass parameters

The most obvious weakness with the stream cipher approach, even with a higher number of initial rounds of key stretching (`initialRecursions`), is that it would be relatively easy to brute force offline if you know the shape of the beginning of the plaintext. For example, if you know it's a JSON object, then the first character should be `""{""`. When guessing, you don't need to decrypt the entire data, just the first couple characters should suffice.

To help mitigate this, I implemented a [""multipass"" mode](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/90cec1697863db4a1cd987df3d8231f3e2b7a5c1/src/types.mts#L124). When used in combination with an [`AlphabetIndexingMode`](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/90cec1697863db4a1cd987df3d8231f3e2b7a5c1/src/types.mts#L61) of `""lastIndexOf""` and a ""sufficiently high"" pass count, this creates a couple interesting dynamics. It forces the decryption to work over the entire section, as each 1-time alphabet is only extended once per section pass. So if there are 3 passes and 3 hex plaintext characters `""abc""` in the section, the alphabets would be built A, B, C, AA, BB, CC, AAA, BBB, CCC. So there is a relatively high probability that the last index of `""a""` will not be in the first hash digest alphabet. This also has the interesting quality of placing the alphabet-building phase in memory, creating a possibly memory-hard algorithm.

## thanks

There are many more implementation details of course, but I feel I've already written more than enough here. Of all the research I've done, I can say that this has qualities *like* those involved in many existing systems, e.g. a Feistel network. But the only thing to my eyes that looks really close is the ""Message encryption using a hash function"" patent, though again that works at the binary level. The fundamental reason I like this particular approach is that it leverages cryptographic hashes as a whole to reduce and/or concentrate complexity. For just one example, this turns out AFAICT to mitigate against timing attacks ""for free"". But since this works at a high level, it obviously has a performance bloat. I'm wondering if further cryptanalysis by experts would show that it is fundamentally flawed or that it would be a big, slow - but effective - cousin of the new encryption algorithms out there.

Thanks for your time."

And when it came to cryptography, I never learned why the algorithms worked, I simply learned the algorithms and applied them. Not because I didn't want to, but because I really had no time to understand them.

The only book that seems to delve into the intuition of why the math works is Cryptographic Engineering. It's the only book that delved into the number theory in detail. But having one resource, kind of, isn't ideal. I really like supplementing reading materials."

Mnemonikey | Determinstic PGP key recovery using phrases | v0.0.1 prerelease published,45,143fu2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/143fu2y/mnemonikey_determinstic_pgp_key_recovery_using/,1,2023-06-07 10:10:49,"[I have published my first ever tagged release of Mnemonikey,](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/releases/tag/v0.0.1) a novel CLI tool and Go library which allows PGP users to derive their PGP keys deterministically from a seed which is exported as a phrase of 14 words for easy offline backup. This works much in the same way keys for Bitcoin wallets can be deterministically derived from a recovery phrase.

As far as I'm aware, Mnemonikey is the first of its kind, rhyming only with the related but conceptually different [`passphrase2pgp` tool](https://github.com/skeeto/passphrase2pgp), from which I drew my original inspiration.

This first release marks a point which I feel is suitable for a v1 release, but before that I'd first like to send out some feedback requests in various communities to ask for final feedback and, for those most interested, testing of the library and/or CLI tool.


[Y'all were extremely helpful when I made my initial feedback request](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/zoezpt/mnemonikey_determinstic_backup_and_recovery_of/), and by now the ripest fruits of that feedback have been implemented. Notably:

- [The seed and creation time is hashed with Argon2id before deriving keys, to reduce the feasibility of a batched brute force attack.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/19)
- [The epoch has been bumped to New Year 2023.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/24)
- [We are now using a custom 4096-word list](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/26). This allows for denser encoding, and provides word-to-word distance guarantees.
- [Added support for password-encrypted recovery phrases.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/28)
- [Added a `convert` command to convert recovery phrases between encrypted and plaintext formats, and to change the passwords of encrypted phrases.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/33)
- [Added a script to construct static, reproducible builds of the `mnemonikey` CLI tool.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/36)

Basically I'm reading [this paper by the NTRU Prime team](https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/latticerisks-20211031.pdf) and in section 2.5 it's explaining how cyclotomic fields should be replaced with prime degree fields with ""big Galois group"", namely because how structures within cyclotomic fields (e.g. subfields and automorphism) can potentially lead to an attack in the future, it then states ""Fields with big Galois groups are far from having automorphisms.""

This sentence confuses me because to my understanding a Galois group is the group of all automorphisms in a field extension, so wouldn't a ""big Galois group"" imply having a lot of automorphisms? 

It also goes on to state how NTRU Prime field has a Galois group of size p!, whereas NTRU field's has size p-1. How exactly does the size of the Galois group correlate to security of the KEM?

I hope I've worded my question clearly since again I'm still very new to this. Thanks."

I'm excited to introduce you to a project I've been working on in the past weeks: Sequency.

Sequency is a lightweight C++ library that makes generating random numbers effortless. Whether you're designing a game with unpredictable elements, or a simulation that requires robust randomization, Sequency is can empower your project.

**Project:**

 I wrote Sequency with the intent of creating a very easy-to-implement and light PRNG library. As we can see, there are crypto libraries like OpenSSL which make everything too overly complicated for simple applications; Sequency is designed to be simple and effective. 

**Contributing:**

Contributing to Sequency is super simple, in fact, my initial intent was to have a lot of people contribute to it for its semplicity. So yeah! I'd really really really like contributions, whether they're new algorithms, documentation improvments, code comments or anything else!

I'd love to see people contribute to my project with complicated PRNGs like  Rijndael or MARS in CTR, ISAAC, Fortuna or any other algorithm!  
Feel free to contribute, suggest, or criticize my work!

For more information about Sequency and how to use it, you can check out the project on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/JoshuaKasa/Sequency).

Kryptos passage 1 decryption possible new information.,0,13ifypx,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/13ifypx/kryptos_passage_1_decryption_possible_new/,4,2023-05-15 13:23:41,"I am going to preface this I don't take credit for the work I used chat gpt for the heavy lifting of it. I just did the prompts.

 I looked at the right two passages and noticed they had the same pattern I then looked and saw it was a vigenere cipher. I asked chat gpt if it had the ability to work a vigenere cipher and it said it could and I had it do a frequency analysis.  They key it gave back after a frequency analysis was ""KRYPTOSISTHEKEY"".  I asked it to apply the key and I got back this response. ""BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENCEOFLIGHTLIESTHENUANCEOFIQLUCKIERSTILLISTHEHIDDENAGENDAOFTHECIPHERSINTERPENETRATINGSYMBOLS""

""BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQ LUCKIER STILL IS  
 

THE HIDDEN AGENDA OF THE CIPHERS INTERPENETRATING SYMBOLS""    


There is more information I do not know if this correct I just thought I would share this since it could be more information to the first passage. 

If you want to recreate this I prompted by  Vigenere cipher  and not saying its about Kryptos and had it treat it like a random cipher.  I first did identify and then frequency then asked to find the key off frequency then applied the key. 

""

I can certainly try! Based on the frequency analysis of the ciphertext, we can make educated guesses about the most likely letters used to encrypt each column. Here are the most likely letters for each column:

* Column 1: ""K""
* Column 2: ""R""
* Column 3: ""Y""
* Column 4: ""P""
* Column 5: ""O""
* Column 6: ""S""
* Column 7: ""T""
* Column 8: ""A""
* Column 9: ""I""
* Column 10: ""C""
* Column 11: ""H""
* Column 12: ""E""
* Column 13: ""R""
* Column 14: ""O""
* Column 15: ""S""
* Column 16: ""A""

Based on these guesses, we can construct a potential key as follows: ""KRYPTOSISTHEKEY"". This key has a repeating pattern of length 13, which corresponds to the length of the key used to encrypt the message.  
""

This is a quote about the columns and the key it formed for reference to other people."

To bring people up to speed, I got this question in my examination and I tried brainstorming it but couldn't figure out how the question was supposed to be solved with those 4 constants.

I asked my professor about it and turns out, all we needed to do was make a 2x2 Matrix using those constants, mod 27 it and then round it off to get integers. I don't think the question was clear about this instruction. I was wondering if we could come up with some absurd algorithm along the lines of hill cipher which uses those 4 constants to generate a 4x4 random Matrix and use that for hill cipher?"

Why is the use of Lagrange Bases in PLONK considered a big innovation?,14,136698p,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/136698p/why_is_the_use_of_lagrange_bases_in_plonk/,2,2023-05-02 20:12:14,"Why is the use of Lagrange Bases in PLONK regarded as a major innovation? 

The L in PLONK stands for Lagrange & I have seen videos & tweets by both Ariel Gabizon & Zac Williamson where they emphasise this particular aspect of PLONK - that it uses Lagrange Bases. 

I think PLONK's predecessor SONIC didn't use Lagrange Polynomials. However, SNARKs older than SONIC like Groth16 or Pinocchio do use Lagrange Interpolation to convert R1CS to QAP. In both Groth16 & Pinocchio, if your solution vector is of length `s` & your circuit has `g` gates, then you use Lagrange Interpolation to create `3s` polynomials each of degree `g-1` in the process of converting the R1CS to the QAP form.

So why so much fuss made about PLONK's use of Lagrange Bases? What am I missing? 
Another thing which makes me think I am missing something they emphasise the Lagrange ""base"" part rather than talking about the interpolation. But the Lagrange Base is just a part (the first step) of the Interpolation process."

Creating throwaway public keys?,9,131jbo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/131jbo4/creating_throwaway_public_keys/,12,2023-04-28 01:07:10,"I'm considering building a system that tracks user accounts as public keys. For privacy reasons I want users to be able to create decoy accounts by registering a throwaway public key. I could instruct users to create a key pair normally, and then to discard the private key.

I'd like to create a helper system that would allow users to create decoy accounts in bulk. The user would need to trust this system not to keep private keys. If it's possible, I'd like to find a way to create a public key without actually creating private keys. I'd document that process, open source the code, and then run it on the helper system. In my use case, I expect some users to be able to trust that the helper system isn't running different code, generating private keys, and stealing them.

A naive approach would be to just create something that looks like a public key, but is actually just randomized. I'm concerned this would create a weak key, like an RSA key that can be factored really easily, or something that's easy to detect as a decoy because the structure is unusual. That would fail to meet the security or privacy requirements

I can support RSA or ECDSA algorithms. Is this something others have studied, documented, and used before?"
How much secure is my UDP based network protocol?,28,12yg97k,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/12yg97k/how_much_secure_is_my_udp_based_network_protocol/,24,2023-04-25 06:14:31,"I implemented a minimalistic reliable UDP network library (designed for real-time uses like games, but also for generic virtual p2p connections), and I would love to hear any feedback on the potential design flaws of my protocol.

The cryptographic library used is libsodium.

I use AEAD encryption for the confidentiality and integrity of the session message data (xchacha20-poly1305) and naturally public key cryptography for the session keys exchange at the start of the connection.

All keys are 256 bits (32 bytes), and all nonces are 192 bits (24 bytes). For the session nonces, I just increment the nonces as counters, and I know how much to increment because I use a sequence number for every message fragment (I dont' even send the nonce). I read from libsodium website that there is no pratical need to change session keys with xchacha20-poly1305, so I don't renegotiate session keys.

Naturally the problem is the actual exchange of session keys and nonces at the start of the connection. When a connection is accepted by the ""server"" (let's use the server-client for better describing a peer connecting and another accepting connections), I generate the symmetric session keys and nonces server side and send them to the ""client"" if the conneciton is accepted. I assume the client knows the server public key, and I use throw-away identities for encrypting the session keys in order to have some form of ""perfect forward-secrecy"" (the nonces are encrypted too even if not strictly necessary).

The protocol for initiating a connection is very minimalistic, and is composed of just 2 messages: a client request and a server response (or silence if the request was declined).

&#x200B;

Client side (connection request):

1. Generate client identity if necessary
2. Generate client throw-away (""ephemeral"") identity
3. Generate a message composed of plain data and encrypted payload: (client\_public\_key | random nonce | Encrypt\_server\_pk\_client\_sk( timestamp | ephemeral\_client\_public\_key | \[padded 0s to increase size to maximum payload size \] ))

The client\_public\_key is there because the server will need it to decrypt the payload, the nonce is randomly generated for every request. The timestamp is used for discarding old connection requests, and the padded zeros are there because it is a way to prevent the server to be exploited in some form DDOS attacks against other targets (I read it is good manner to make packet size request always > packet size response).

&#x200B;

Server side (connection response):

1. Decrypt client payload with client public key and server secret key to retrieve timestamp and ephemeral\_client\_public\_key.
2. Check timestamp to discard old requests.
3. Generate server ephemeral/throw-away identity.
4. Generate 2 random session symmetric keys and 2 random nonces (send and recv keys are different).
5. Use the client ephemeral identity and server ephemeral identity to encrypt the session keys and nonces.
6. Send the message to the client: (server\_public\_key | random\_nonce | ECRYPT\_client\_pk\_server\_sk( ephemeral\_server\_public\_key | encrypted\_session\_keys\_and\_nonces ))

&#x200B;

The client checks that the server public key match the stored one, and then try to decrypt the payload. If decryption is succesfull, it has all the information necessary to decrypt the session keys and nonces using the ephemeral identity of the server.

Is my protocol reasonable enough or I made some dangerous mistake I'm not aware of?

Thank you in advance for any feedback!"

Since hash is one way, knowing p1, p2, ‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt tell anything about p. Also, if p is strong, say it‚Äôs a 256 bits key, brute forcing any of these passwords is not an option.

I have a performance and cost vs rotation frequency tradeoff that I'm trying to balance. I've been so far unable to find concrete information about risks of key reuse that would let me choose an evidence-based tolerance for how much key reuse is still cryptographically secure.

Let's say I have an arbitrary number of AES 256 GCM ciphertexts that were encrypted using the same key but a unique and random IV for each. Excluding side-channel attacks, is there a known attack that could take advantage of the repeated key use to help me get the plaintexts? How many repeated usages are needed before the attack becomes feasible?

Let's also say I obtained the corresponding plaintext for many of the ciphertexts via other means. Could having a multitude of ciphertext/plaintext pairs help me decrypt other plaintexts? Similarly to above, how many would be needed?

Does encrypting a file from one app allows me to decrypt from another device or software?,3,12ahkho,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/12ahkho/does_encrypting_a_file_from_one_app_allows_me_to/,4,2023-04-03 06:34:12,"So say if I encrypt one file from an app in my phone. Later, can I use another software from my PC to decrypt it, if I pick the same encryption algorithm? Or is it more complex than that? Are there software specific information added to the file when encrypting? I suppose simply encrypting and decrypting text would work but I am not sure about files. Or is this a question without one single answer, where it would maybe work with some applications and not with others?

If possible, I would prefer to use VeraCrypt for PC to decrypt files I would encrypt with an app on my phone, but I am not sure it would work since it VeraCrypt sort of has containers and mounts them to be drives?, in which case I would try to use something else.

Real World Cryptography - exercise Chapter 7,10,122wwew,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/122wwew/real_world_cryptography_exercise_chapter_7/,5,2023-03-26 14:36:00,"Spoilers below.

In Real World Cryptography, Chapter 3.3.4, the author explains how MAC tag comparisons can be vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks. Essentially, the attacker guesses each possible value for the first byte of the tag, and when the verification routine takes the longest, this means the first byte is correct. 

Then, Chapter 7 has the following exercise (7.1):
> As you saw in chapter 3, authentication tags produced by MACs must be verified in constant time to avoid timing attacks. Do you think we need to do the same for verifying signatures?

The solution given at the end of the book is:
> No. is is because the verification of an authentication tag involves a secret key. Verifying a signature only involves a public key and, thus, does not need to be verified in constant time.

Does anyone else think this answer is a bit unclear, and maybe slightly misleading? When an attacker uses the timing side-channel attack, they're not attacking the secret key of the MAC scheme, but rather the MAC tag itself. In my opinion, the answer makes it sound like signatures are safe from these attacks because the public key is public. 

I feel like a better explanation would be that MAC schemes and signature schemes are fundamentally different in how the MAC tag/signature is verified. Because MACs are symmetric cryptography, verification involves recomputing the MAC tag and then comparing it with the provided MAC tag. Whereas signatures are asymmetric, so verification is a completely different operation which generally doesn't involve any comparison. Of course, this does indirectly link back to secret keys vs public/private keys.

Am I missing something here?"

There might be also some metadata, such as email address. 

But other than that, is there any risk with publishing public keys on internet? 

Put in another way, does a public key reveal any information that could help an attacker in any way? 

Perhaps those familiar with details of different types of asymmetric keys could comment on potential attacks on public keys."
Is permutation-based crypto not catching on in the wild?,33,1208h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1208h1b/is_permutationbased_crypto_not_catching_on_in_the/,20,2023-03-23 23:03:16,"Permutation-based crypto is an approach to building symmetric-key cryptographic schemes defined by a pseudorandom permutation and a ""construction"" that uses the permutation, where the scheme is provably secure as long as the permutation satisfies certain properties. As far as I understand this makes it easier to trust the resulting schemes as safe because a single ""good"" permutation gives credibility to many potential schemes that use it. (Not a cryptographer.)

Permutation-based schemes seem to have taken over the cryptologic world by storm. Very quickly after the introduction of the Sponge construction around 2006/2007, many of the competing submissions for the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function contest were based on a sponge and a permutation, and indeed, Keccak (by the inventors of the sponge) won the competition. Some years afterwards, permutation-based submissions similarly dominated the CAESAR and the NIST Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) authenticated encryption competitions. In the meantime various variants on the sponge construction were introduced (duplex, donkeysponge, monkeyduplex).

Furthermore, it was apparent that permutation-based crypto offers a drastically simpler way to build an entire symmetric cryptography system with most of the implementation code reused compared to previous approaches. For example, to achieve authenticated encryption with the ChaCha20 stream cipher, one would usually pair it with the Poly1305 MAC. Permutation-based crypto, on the other hand, allows a single algorithm to be both a hash-function, extendable output function (XOF), MAC, and authenticated stream cipher. This makes permutation-based crypto look like the natural choice for implementing symmetric cryptography systems.

To paraphrase a paper by Daniel J. Bernstein et al (Gimli), a permutation being a better unified primitive than a block cipher seems to be a new conventional wisdom.

The sponge construction is inherently sequential, which was problematic for achieving competitive performance on modern computer architectures (because they enable parallel computation in multiple ways). This is why, ten years after the Sponge construction, the Keccak team published the Farfalle construction, a sort of parallel counterpart to the Sponge: https://keccak.team/farfalle.html

However, after all these (and other) developments in cryptology (perhaps even a revolution?), it seems that permutation-based crypto is still almost unused in ""the wild"", with no sign of this changing. Am I right about this?

I guess that the Keccak permutation may be too-slow to be competitive in all cases, and the other ones aren't yet vetted enough to be considered safe? Is it merely a matter of time until the permutation-based crypto revolution translates into the world of programming and network protocols?

Am I missing something?"
Hiding documents inside video files?,6,11zuqih,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/11zuqih/hiding_documents_inside_video_files/,8,2023-03-23 14:34:22,"I'm new, so pls don't hate too much

I've been wondering how hard it would be for an untrained person to steal internal company documents by hiding their contents inside a video file, uploading that file to youtube, and then allowing some 3rd party to download it with a youtube video downloader.

Can be done in an obvious way, just has to be viewable as video. Doesn't have to be anything crazy, like making the video look normal, it's fine if the video looks like a mess.

I tried to do it myself by tinkering with renaming, writing and converting mp4, txt and gif files. I failed.

The reason why I'm interested, is because tinkering with files that you already have on your PC, as well as uploading the video to youtube is undetectable by IDS systems (they are like antivirus programs, but for network traffic for the whole company). The only thing an IDS would notice is that a lot of data was uploaded to youtube, but it wouldn't be able to tell what it was, because the communication is encrypted. There also wouldn't be any way to know which account the person used to do it.

If you're worrying about what I'm going to do with this information, I work in cybersecurity and I'm just interested."

If I used a stream cipher, I'd have to use a fairly big nonce to prevent the catastrophic consequences of nonce reuse. I'm instead considering using CBC with ciphertext stealing, since I think the worst consequence of IV reuse here would be that an attacker could tell if two passwords start with the same string - which doesn't seem concerning for randomly generated passwords. I could thus probably get away with a very small (1-byte), or possibly even no IV. Am I correct in this thinking?"

# Google Summer of Code 2023

I'm pleased to announce that OpenFHE has been accepted to GSoC 2023 under the NumFOCUS umbrella (see [2023 project listing](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2023/ideas-list.md)). Our proposed projects are listed on our [wiki](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/wiki/GSOC-2023) but TL;DR we're hoping to expand the library's reach by providing SDKs for  

- iOS
- Android

and we're hoping to create a backend for [HEBench](https://github.com/hebench), which is an open-source framework for profiling various FHE libraries.

You don't *need* to have a background in FHE, but it might be helpful. We're mostly looking for strong programmers who are interested in learning more about FHE and getting their hands dirty.

# About OpenFHE

**What is FHE**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the secret key.

**What is OpenFHE**: From [our github page](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development): OpenFHE is an open-source FHE library that includes efficient implementations of all common FHE schemes:

- Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
- Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
- Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic (includes approximate bootstrapping)
- Ducas-Micciancio (DM) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (CGGI) schemes for evaluating Boolean circuits and arbitrary functions over larger plaintext spaces using lookup tables

If you've heard of [PALISADE](https://palisade-crypto.org/), OpenFHE is its spiritual successor, integrating our various learnings and contributions across industry and academia.

I am trying to learn certain aspects of more modern cryptography. As a way to learn, I chose to do a simple CLI tool to encrypt data (like a file) to a PURB using a public key (think something like Age, but producing PURBs and with less functionality). This tool is obviously not for production use (unless someone volunteers to audit it, lol).

While I understand how it can work for symmetric crypto, I am looking to ultimately add public key cryptography to the tool. In this case, for PURBs to remain PURBs, I will need to use some procedure to make the key material look like uniform randomness as well.

I've taken a look at obfs4, because they do something similar to what I want, and they are using [Elligator 2](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4/blob/master/doc/obfs4-spec.txt#L154) to make their key exchange look like random data. I've also heard of it being used elsewhere for similar purposes. I've then tried to look for libraries that implement this functionality. I am primarily focused on Golang, so that's where I started to look. For example, I found this library: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto#Point.SetElligator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto#Point.SetElligator), but I was unable to understand their documentation, because I do not know some of the terms they use. I also tried to look for Lizard encoding and found nothing.

Another library that I took a look at is Monocypher: [https://monocypher.org/manual/elligator](https://monocypher.org/manual/elligator). Their documentation is much easier to read, but I am still confused, because they use yet another set of terminology compared to the Go library.

This is not in any way an attempt to say that these libraries are bad, they are certainly oriented at people who know what they are doing while I certainly don't, but I would love to learn about this stuff. Can you please give me some pointers where I can learn what all the terminology means, and how the different parts of these systems interact together?

I know this may not be appropriate, but this particular release is kind of important. The main reason for this release is because, like many other libraries out there, its EdDSA signatures API was [prone to catastrophic misuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/vfl2se/initial_impact_report_about_this_weeks_eddsa/). And now it's fixed.

_<rant> I will quickly note that this class of vulnerabilities could have been avoided if the original authors of NaCl had prominently explained why they put the private & public halves together in the same private key. The fact that not doing so could be just as catastrophic as a nonce reuse should have been noted in the original Ed25519 paper. Instead many of us found ourselves thinking the NaCl API was kind of ugly, and went on separating the private & public halves because it looks cleaner, or is more flexible. </rant>_

There are lots of little changes, and a few big ones:

- Full Argon2 support. Argon2i, Argon2d, Argon2id, multiple lanes. (Multiple lanes are for compatibility only, they don't actually use multi-threading). And the code got simpler to boot. I will likely ask the IETF/CFRG to add it to the RFC.
- Safer EdDSA API. Now private keys are 64 bytes, and include their own public half. Manual says don't split those halves, or else.
- EdDSA now behaves exactly like the Zebra library.
- Replaced the incremental and custom hash EdDSA API by a proper set of low-level functions.

The last two deserve a bit more explanation.

---

First the Zebra compatibility. Monocypher now uses the batch verification equation (that ignores the low-order components of the points it checks), non-canonical encodings are permitted, and low-order points are permitted. Of course, Non-canonical S encoding are still forbidden, we don't want malleability. My reasons for this choice are best explained in [Henry de Valence's post on the subject](https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am).

The choice of accepting low-level points can seem surprising, given that other libraries, most notably libsodium and parts of Dalek, chose on the contrary to forbid them. I initially thought of following the RFC, but I ran into a couple problems:

- The RFC gives you a choice between the batch equation *or* the strict equation.
- The RFC forbids non-canonical encodings, which are a pain to check for. Well, at least they only affect low-order points‚Ä¶
- ‚Ä¶which are _allowed_ by the RFC.

Now I understand why almost no one conforms to the RFC. So I've chosen to be maximally permissive instead. That way I'm sure to accept any signature that is considered valid by another library (except TweetNaCl, which does not check for malleability), in particular those who perform batch verification, whose speed up can't be ignored. Also, accepting low-order points & non-canonical encodings is just simpler. Sure we could ban them, but this wouldn't increase security one bit: recipients need to validate the public keys they receive anyway, otherwise attackers could just provide their own key.

---

Second, the low-level API. This whole endeavour started from someone asking me to implement Ed25519ph for them. I initially warned them that I was relatively expensive, and tried to steer them to cheaper alternatives. They paid up. And so I worked. And that work gave me a deeper understanding of some low-level aspects of EdDSA, and the idea for a new low-level API emerged. Without this job you probably wouldn't see this new API today.

So. I used to love my incremental and custom hash API but it was complicated, somewhat error prone, and quite rigid. So I took the opportunity of the major release to replace it by this simpler and more flexible idea I had:

* One function to trim scalars (clearing 4 bits and setting one).
* One function to reduce 64-byte numbers modulo L (the order of the prime order subgroup of the curve).
* A mul-add function (modulo L).
* A fixed based scalar multiplication (with a trimmed or untrimmed scalar).
* A ""check equation"" function.

Turned out that from those, it's pretty easy to implement various EdDSA variants, including something like an incremental API, an API that uses a hedged nonce (composed of a hash of the message *and* a random component), or an API closer to ECDSA for users who don't want to hash the message twice (not implemented nor encouraged in the manual for obvious reasons), or variants of EdDSA, such as Ed25519ph (implemented as an option), or XEdDSA (exemplified in the manual). And of course the custom hash ability, which I needed to implement EdDSA-Blake2b and Ed25519.

Note the odd one out, `crypto_check_equation()`. It's pretty high level, but it turned out to be enough. The main advantage there is that users have only *one* verification to make. Once they've hashed the relevant input they just give it the public key, hash, and signature, and it takes care of everything, including key validation. I'm very glad to see this ""low-level"" verification API being mostly foot-gun free.

Another advantage is the flexibility in the implementation: I'm not bound to the double scalar multiplication, and can explore various trade-offs. Which I will_ eventually, there are plans for an ""embedded"" edition of Monocypher, tailored for smaller chips such as the Cortex M0."

One idea I'm experimenting with is peppering data by encrypting them with secret keys stored only in ENV variables.

I can easily do that with data that I don't search. Since I don't search them, I can generate a random nonce for each encryption.

My problem is doing that with e-mails, since I need them to be searchable. So I need the encrypted e-mails to be deterministic and secure.

Right now my approach is to reuse the nonce to keep the encrypted e-mails searchable. I'm using Libsodium's XChaCha20-Poly1305 to encrypt.

Is it possible to encrypt e-mails securely while keeping them searchable in the database? What library can I use to do this in JS?

"Using ""sedutil"" for SSD hardware-encryption on Windows non-operating-system SSD drives",2,112io1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/112io1d/using_sedutil_for_ssd_hardwareencryption_on/,0,2023-02-14 16:54:40,"The following questions are about using hardware-encryption on Windows non-operating-system SSD drives via ""sedutil"".

&#x200B;

We are fully aware that using hardware-encryption on a Windows operating-system drive (""C:"" drive) is much more complicated and requires setting up a PBA, etc.

&#x200B;

So, all of the questions are assuming that the main operating-system drive (Windows ""C:"" drive) is not hardware-encrypted, and only the other non-operating-system SSD drives (""D:"", ""E:"" and ""F:"") are hardware-encrypted using ""sedutil-cli.exe"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(1)

When using ""sedutil"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives on Windows (not Linux), is Sleep (S3) supported?  In other words, can a computer with ""sedutil-cli.exe"" unlocked non-operating-system drive(s) be put to ""Sleep"", wake from sleep and no problems with using those hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drive(s) as such?

&#x200B;

The main ""sedutil"" github page says that Sleep (S3) is not supported, but it is unclear to us whether they are referring only to Linux or to both Linux and Windows:

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(2)

If the answer to (1) is ""NO"", then does this mean that only Windows hibernation is supported when using ""sedutil"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives?  Or is Windows hibernation not supported either?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(3)

If Windows hibernation is supported using ""sedutil-cli"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives, then consider the following simple use case:

&#x200B;

Suppose we used ""sedutil-cli.exe"" to unlock sedutil-hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives ""D:"", ""E:"" and ""F:"" - and those hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives are in use by applications and/or are even running applications.

&#x200B;

Then, we put the machine to ""Hibernate"" - the machine is now in a fully powered-off state.

&#x200B;

We turn the machine back on - the machine loads the contents of RAM from the hibernation image file (""C:\\hiberfil.sys""), and resumes the operating-system and all running applications - supposedly to the same state as the computer had been, right at being set to hibernate.

&#x200B;

Are drives ""D:"" ""E:"" and ""F:"" still unlocked, functioning and usable without crashing any applications and without any other issues?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only information we have on using ""sedutil"" on non-root (non-operating-system) drives are from the following wiki, but most of the sedutil docs are linux-only and do not really explain how to make hardware-encryption work with sleep/hibernate/etc. on Windows: 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Self-encrypting\_drives#Encrypting\_a\_non-root\_drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Self-encrypting_drives#Encrypting_a_non-root_drive)  (slightly helpful but outdated)

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Encrypting-your-drive](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Encrypting-your-drive) (not very helpful to us because it only explains the more-complicated setup of PBA for operating-system drives.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(4)

Upon reading the manual, ""sedutil-cli.exe"" provides a very non-intuitive user-interface with complicated command-line-arguments that are very difficult (at least for us) to understand:

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Command-Syntax](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Command-Syntax)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It is definitely not as simple as using the BitLocker CLI which is as simple as:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For hardware-encrypting drive F: with password-protector - should be instantaneous since hardware-encryption, unlike software-encryption, is instantaneous:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -on F: -ForceEncryptionType hardware -Password

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For locking drive F:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -lock F:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For unlocking drive F:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -unlock F:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For checking status of all drives:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -status

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If someone could provide the equivalent commands for using ""sedutil-cli.exe"" to do all of the tasks above, that would also be greatly appreciated."

I want to get expert's opinions on implementing security and brute-force resistance to PBKDF2. The project is a desktop database (no cloud - local storage) application that CRUDs proprietary sensitive data. 

First, my threat model warrants that offline attacks are the most concern. Should someone steal the database, I want resistance. I am less concerned about online attacks.

I chose an on-the-fly design. Data is encrypted/decrypted as it is read/written to the database. With that said, I am responsible for securing the backend. Not the DB system. So here are some questions, give the context.

Note:  Assume all encryption is AES-256 CBC mode. I wasn't concerned with offline attacks until I read about modern gaming GPU stacks cracking tons of passwords in a single day. 

1.).  PBKDF2 - Does simply using PBKDF2 to lengthen a key prior to AES256 provide enough entropy to be practically impossible to crack? I know the rounds are used to make computationally expensive. The problem is, I must keep rounds 500 - 1000 to meet performance requirements. 

2.) What relationship exists between rounds of PBKDF2 and brute forcing raw cipher text? People say that lengthening your user password to a KDF is far more efficient than increasing rounds. OK. So why don't I just hash the password or lengthen it somehow before inputing into the KDF? Because all that did was simulate a single KDF 'Round/interation' ?

3.) Is it acceptable to use PBKDF2 or another KDF as a hash function for authentication? Just curious. I've seen mixed discussion on this. 

Thanks for your help and discussion!"

Github: [https://github.com/Avarok-Cybersecurity/Citadel-Protocol](https://github.com/Avarok-Cybersecurity/Citadel-Protocol)

The Citadel Protocol now offers a Remote Encrypted Virtual Filesystem (RE-VFS) feature with post-quantum security integrated into the protocol. This will allow clients, peers, and servers to use each other as remote storage endpoints using virtualized file directories. Additionally, this improves security for file storage, as this separates the private key used for decryption from the storage node. This will force hackers to compromise both endpoints in order to compromise the file rather than having to compromise just a singular point. Finally, since RE-VFS is built over The Citadel Protocol, all perks of using the protocol, such as multi-layered cryptography and multi-layered ratcheting, are available to greatly increase the security of the files.

Why is the Key in Blake2's keyed mode kept in a separate block?,21,10nuocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10nuocy/why_is_the_key_in_blake2s_keyed_mode_kept_in_a/,9,2023-01-28 18:53:17,"As far as I know, Blake2 (I'm thinking of Blake2b specifically) has a keyed mode that is intended to be used as a key derivation function: put the input key material in the key, and if there's enough entropy the whole thing is a Random Oracle, and the output can be used as an encryption key.

Now when it comes to actually adding the key to the input, Blake2 doesn't do the obvious:

    Blake2b(key || other_stuff)

And we don't even need to insert the key size in there to ensure proper separation between `key` and `other_stuff`, since the key size is already encoded in the parameter block.

Instead, it reserves an _entire block_ for the key:

    block = key || zeroes -- 128 bytes total
    Blake2b(block || other_stuff)

Which is kind of a pity, because if the total length of the `key` and `other_stuff` doesn't exceed a single block, we end up hashing 2 blocks regardless, while the obvious approach would have let us hash only 1.

I do understand that it does help with some optimisations: loading data byte by byte on my laptop almost halved overall speed, so having the `other_stuff` start at a block boundary does make things a bit easier on that front. But to be honest I'm not sure that's the only reason. I'm afraid in particular that there's a security consideration. Personally I can think of two:

- Making sure the key goes through the compression function before we process the other input (that is more likely to be attacker controlled) may mitigate some side channel attacks (faults, energy).
- Maybe compressing the key alone helps with mathematical security as well? Maybe that's what it take for us to be sure that Blake2 is indistinguishable from a Random Oracle?

Even more confusing, the size of the key isn't limited to 128 bytes. It's limited to only 64. (Same for Blake2s where blocks are 64 bytes, keys are limited to 32 bytes.) Of the top of my head I can see only one reason: minimising attacker controlled inputs. Salsa20 and ChaCha20 do this: 16 bytes for a constant, 32 bytes for a key, and the remaining 16 bytes may be attacker controlled (and even so, 8 of them are likely not, because it's the counter). Thing is, the only thing we give Blake2 here is the _key_, so making sure at least half of the block isn't attacker controlled makes little sense: _nothing_ is attacker controlled, it's supposed to be a key, right?

_Whyyy?_

---

_(This is not just an academic question: I would like to know if I can safely use `Blake2b(key_size || key || other_stuff)` as a KDF, or if I need to stick to the official API.)_

---

Update: I've got an answer to why the key is separated to its own block. From the [HKDF paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/264.pdf), page 22, we can read:

> For random SKM, HKDF becomes an application of HMAC which is the standard and widely accepted PRF mode for Merkle-Damgard hash functions. The traditional scheme, in contrast, builds the PRF using the hash function in ‚Äúkey-prepended mode‚Äù, a mode that has long been deprecated in favor of schemes such as HMAC. In particular, key-prepended schemes need to care about extension attacks thus requiring careful prefix-free encoding of the input. Moreover, such a scheme does not even follow the usual practice of aligning (via padding) the prepended key to a block boundary (as to induce a random IV).

So:

* HMAC is rad because it turns random compression functions into random oracles. That's why it's so often the way to go, especially with the SHA-2 family of hashes, which because of length extension attacks cannot be modeled as random oracles. Now to be checked, but I'm pretty sure modern hashes like BLAKE2 and SHA-3 also turn their internal (assumed random) compression function into a random oracle. Thus, no need for HMAC on these, its capabilities are built in.

* The reason the key needs to live in its own block, is to give BLAKE2 a random IV instead of a predictable one. My guess here is that starting to compress the input only _after_ we get that random IV makes security reductions easier‚Ä¶ or _possible_.

As for why the key size cannot exceed half the block size, I think we can deduce it by looking at BLAKE2b itself: see, when the compression function has processed 128 bytes worth of input, it only retains a 64-bit hash. The whole scheme cannot _possibly_ accumulate more than 64 bytes of entropy, so we might as well make it a hard limit, so users _know_ keys can't get any stronger."

RSA with modulo close to power of 2,11,10jafmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10jafmu/rsa_with_modulo_close_to_power_of_2/,8,2023-01-23 05:36:53,"I noticed that when generating an RSA key, one can easily choose the primes making up the modulo so that the modulo is close to a power of 2. For instance when generating a 4096 bit key first choose a prime somewhere around 2^2048 like normally, then compute 2^4096 divided by the chosen prime and find a prime just below that number. Using these two primes the modulo will be on the form `2^4096 - n` where `n` is a number slightly larger than 2048 bits.

As best I can tell this will speed up public operations by making the modulo operation approximately twice as fast. For private operations using the Chinese Remainder trick this modulo is used less, thus making the gain relatively smaller.

I don't believe there is any known factoring method that could take serious advantage of this form.

I guess I'm not the first person to notice this, and with RSA generally being replaced I guess this won't ever see much use, but I found it curious."

Can someone help me do this POC length extension attack?,20,10iougv,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10iougv/can_someone_help_me_do_this_poc_length_extension/,5,2023-01-22 11:22:25,"Hi, I've been trying to read up on length extension attacks, and wanted to try to do a proof of concept attack.

So, I found [this](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/hlextend) small repo, which should be able to do length extension attacks for me. They have an example for sha1, so I thought I would just do my example with that as well

Lets say that we observe a message a known message which is ""message"" , which has been hashed with the secret key ""secret1234"", which we know is 10 digits long.

So the integrity code would be made with hash(""secret1234""|""message"")

and Then we want to create our own valid hash, where we have appended the word ""file"".

Some very basic proof of concept code would be:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    import hlextend
    import hashlib
    
    
    def hash(message, secret):
        payload = secret + message
        hash_object = hashlib.sha1(bytes(payload,""utf-8""))
        return hash_object.hexdigest()
    
    
    message = ""hello""
    secret = ""secret1234""
    
    ### First, we create our own hash
    print(hash(message, secret)) 
    
    
    
    ## We then try to make a forged hash, using length extension, where we try to append the word ""file""
    sha = hlextend.new('sha1')
    forged = sha.extend(""file"", message, 10,'52e98441017043eee154a6d1af98c5e0efab055c')
    print(forged)
    print(sha.hexdigest())
    
    
    ## and now we check if our forged signature makes is correct:
    
    print(hash(forged,secret))

The extend() function outputs the string that I should be able to use, with padding, in order to create the forged tag

And if I run this code. I will get this  output:

    52e98441017043eee154a6d1af98c5e0efab055c
    hello\x80\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00xfile
    c60fa7de0860d4048a3bfb36b70299a95e6587c9
    876d8406a52c71321930e99ac44740ccaea3d080

If I made the attack correctly, the last two hashes should be the same. But they are not.

&#x200B;

For that reason, I don't know if I have misunderstood something about the length extension attack.

Can someone point out to me what I might be misunderstanding, or doing wrong?"

I've been looking at trying to understand how Signal encrypts attachments and i'm seeing something I don't understand. It uses a pretty standard algorithm (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) but each file appears to contain lots of junk. 

Taking a small 7 byte text file as an example (containing the string ""test123""), it gets encrypted to a file that's 576 bytes. It starts with an IV, then a cipher text of the plaintext, doubled (so in this case, test123test123). There is also a 32 byte mac but I have no idea what all the other data is. When it's decrypted, it looks like Signal just ignores most of the file. It basically just keeps decrypting the file until it has at least as many bytes as the original file, then discards anything over that.

I'm not a crypto expect but do a lot of mobile app reversing and this isn't something i've seen before. I've tried to find an analysis of it, but didn't find much that was publicly available. I emailed some researchers that have looked into it, but haven't heard back yet. The only thing I can think of is that it's a way to obfuscate the file size?"

How to handle encryption key rotation on a realtime collaborative end-to-end encrypted environment?,27,10c2rtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10c2rtc/how_to_handle_encryption_key_rotation_on_a/,5,2023-01-14 16:36:19,"Hey,

I'm currently working on a realtime collaborative end-to-end encrypted note-taking app and I'm wondering how to best handle encryption key rotation. I want to provide the best data safety I can for my users, but also need to implement this for compliance.

In my app each page has a different encryption key for encrypting data. I'm using the Sodium library, so the encryption algorithm is XSalsa20-Poly1305. Pages are contained in groups. Groups represent both page groups and user groups. Each group has an encryption key that encrypts all encryption keys of the contained pages. This group encryption key is asymmetrically distributed to the group users using X25519-XSalsa20-Poly1305. I need to periodically rotate all the keys of a group.

The main problems I'm facing are that groups can become quite big and it's hard to rotate keys while the car is moving without disrupting user interaction or possibly corrupting the data by badly handling key rotation.

I don't think envelope encryption helps in this case because I'm almost sure enveloping doesn't add any security benefits in end-to-end encryption (please correct me if I'm wrong), so it looks like I'm forced to reencrypt all data on key rotation, not just a key.

One detail is that for realtime collaboration I'm using Yjs, which works by transmitting small updates on each user input. In my case each of these updates is encrypted with the page encryption key. Every 500 updates or so I send the whole state of the page to the server in order to merge all the small stored updates, and also for purposes of backup.

So one idea I came up with is to progressively encrypt page data by doing a ""key rollover"" where I generate a new key for all future encryptions, but keep the old key(s) for decryption of old data. This would allow a seamless transition to the new key. However, this would probably require some mechanism to identify and discard old keys, which I'm still unsure how to develop.

So now I have these questions in mind:

* What are other options for key rotation? Is there a simpler way to do this?
* Is envelope encryption really out of question?
* Would I really need to discard old keys in this ""key rollover"" thing? Because if I didn't then my problem is solved right now.

I would really appreciate any insights or advice on this topic. Thanks in advance!"

[Rustdocs](https://avarok-cybersecurity.github.io/Citadel-Protocol/docs/)

[Whitepaper](https://github.com/Avarok-Cybersecurity/Citadel-Protocol/blob/master/The_Citadel_Protocol.pdf)

The Citadel Protocol is a high-performance asynchronous signal-like protocol written in rust that extends upon the ratcheting algorithm by using multi-layered ratcheting, multi-layered encryption, post-quantum key exchange, configurable **true** perfect forward secrecy (each packet gets a unique encryption key via re-keying) or best-effort modes, file-transfer encryption, built-in NAT traversal (no libp2p), configurable credentialed authentication (via argon-2id), device-dependent authentication, or passwordless authentication, amongst other features.

The Citadel Protocol is built on top of an underlying transport protocol. Either TCP, TLS, or QUIC may be used for transport (Default TLS for hybrid cryptography). The Citadel Protocol is used to communicate between nodes in the network.

The network topology contains a central globally-reachable node that is, by default, used for peer discovery and NAT traversal (this node can have application logic endowed unto it, but is not required).  Peers connect to this central server, and, upon registration and connection, are able to then message pass amongst each other and even the central server.

Since NAT traversal is easier to perform with UDP, the QUIC protocol is used for P2P connections as this is complimentary. For Client to server connections, the server can choose to use TCP, TLS, or QUIC as an underlying protocol.

Using the Citadel SDK, rust developers can easily create hyper-secure post-quantum applications that are suitable for client-to-server and p2p applications.

I have been the only developer for the past 5 years. I am now inviting others to come and help improve and guide this project to build an ecosystem of security-aware rust engineers living in the future, for the future."

2. God those key sizes are huge. Any thoughts on generating a very seldom used McEliece keypair deterministically over and over again from a 256 bit seed to save space? I know you can safely do it with ECDH and RSA  as long as the seed is cryptographically random, and is never leaked.

I was thinking further about _why_ we check we are working in the right subgroup, I get that working in 2ùëû,4ùëû,8ùëû is pointless as it provides no extra security due to PH.

I also understand we don't want to work in a small subgroup like 1,2,4,8 as it has security implications, but, as far as I can see, the probability of generating a key which yields one of these 15 points seems infinitesimally small, is the concern only around ECDH (where you cannot control your partners key selection) and not signatures?"

Crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) analytics program, Coinbase Tracer, will provide the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) with data about crypto users, including ‚Äúhistorical geo tracking data‚Äù and transaction history, according to a contract obtained by watchdog group Tech Inquiry.

The contract adds detail to what was previously known about the three-year deal between the crypto exchange and ICE, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Intercept initially reported the news.

A representative for Coinbase denied that the information provided by the analytics software is the exchange‚Äôs customer data.

‚ÄúAll Coinbase Tracer features use data that is fully sourced from online, publicly available data, and do not include any personally identifiable information for anyone, or any proprietary Coinbase user data,‚Äù the spokesperson told CoinDesk.

The deal, which was signed in September for a maximum $1.37 million, is one of several small contracts between Coinbase and U.S. government agencies. In August 2021, Coinbase signed a smaller contract with ICE worth $29,000 to provide the agency with licenses for its analytics software. In April 2021 and May 2020, Coinbase sold licenses ‚Äì both initially under $50,000 ‚Äì from Coinbase Tracer to the U.S. Secret Service.

Coinbase Tracer, formerly known as Coinbase Analytics, has faced controversy before. The branch of the exchange responsible for the software‚Äôs development emerged from Coinbase‚Äôs 2019 acquisition of blockchain intelligence firm Neutrino, whose executive team previously worked with a startup that sold spyware to several governments, including Saudi Arabia, known for human rights abuses."

EU's New Blockchain Guidelines: Existential Threat to Public Blockchains?,4,1kfc74p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kfc74p/eus_new_blockchain_guidelines_existential_threat/,6,2025-05-05 08:54:21,"https://preview.redd.it/ar5ijn7z6xye1.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ce8acc1da16b857e4270c6a3368e00da93553f

# TL;DR

* **EU's new EDPB guidelines could let regulators delete entire blockchains**¬†that can't comply with GDPR's ""right to be forgotten.""
* **Immutability vs Erasure**: Fundamental clash between public blockchain design and EU data deletion requirements.
* **Regulators favor permissioned ('walled garden') chains**‚Äîis this the end of decentralization/self-sovereignty in Europe?
* **Industry pushback**¬†is intense. I share why privacy and decentralization can (and MUST) coexist, plus a 5-step framework for privacy in decentralized systems.
* **Diagram attached**: Visual summary of the privacy vs decentralization dilemma.

# Context: The ‚ÄúKill Switch‚Äù No One Expected

Last month, the¬†**European Data Protection Board (EDPB)**¬†released new guidelines on processing personal data via blockchain. Here‚Äôs the bombshell: if a chain can‚Äôt grant users the ‚Äúright to erasure‚Äù‚Äîmeaning removing their personal data; **regulators may require deletion of the entire blockchain.**

This isn‚Äôt a technical quirk. It‚Äôs a potential death sentence for any public blockchain hosted or operated in the EU, because¬†*immutability*¬†is foundational.

**Industry Reaction?**

* Developers and DeFi founders are already reconsidering EU deployments.
* Projects are eyeing moves to friendlier jurisdictions.
* There‚Äôs deep concern this will freeze Web3 innovation; especially for public, decentralized systems.

# The Fundamental Privacy Paradox

# 1.¬†Immutability vs Erasure

* Public blockchains are designed so data can‚Äôt be deleted or changed (‚Äúcode is law‚Äù).
* GDPR says users¬†*must*¬†be able to request deletion (‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù), or the system is non-compliant.

# 2.¬†Permissioned Chains ‚Äì A Backdoor to Centralization

The guidelines show a clear preference for permissioned blockchains, which:

* Limit access/control to select parties (introducing gatekeepers).
* Undermine true decentralization and user sovereignty.

>

# Why It‚Äôs a False Choice

True privacy doesn‚Äôt require sacrificing decentralization. Public blockchains can‚Äîand already do‚Äîsupport privacy-preserving designs. The¬†***real***¬†risk is regulatory overreach stunting innovation and driving development out of Europe. 

**So what can projects actually do?** 

I definitely don‚Äôt have all the answers, but here are 5 thought-starters‚Äîa ‚ÄúSovereign Data‚Äù framework‚Äîfor navigating these challenges:

1. **Map On-Chain Exposure**: Audit exactly where/how (if at all) personal data exists on-chain. Most data can stay off-chain!
2. **Privacy by Design**: Architect systems so identity is separated from transactions; minimize linkages that could ‚Äúdox‚Äù users.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Infrastructure**: Use zero-knowledge proofs for verifiability without storing personal data.
4. **Geographic/Legal Resilience**: Distribute operations and nodes globally; be smart about where compliance pressure is coming from.
5. **Engage With Policy**: Contribute to the EU‚Äôs guideline consultation, sharing real-world examples of privacy tech that works¬†*without*¬†centralization.

**Key questions for the community:**

* What‚Äôs the most realistic way for a public protocol to respect the GDPR‚Äôs ‚Äúright to erasure‚Äù? Anyone seen this¬†actually¬†solved in the wild?
* Any EU-based devs/subreddit members: how (if at all) is this news changing your roadmap or launch plans?
* Do you see a bigger risk in adapting blockchains to EU law, or in driving all innovation out of Europe?

Would love real-world examples, not just takes!  
(And if you‚Äôre building solutions, is there anything the wider community could do to help?)

I‚Äôve been working on a project inspired by something I felt was missing in the current landscape.  
Most platforms (like Twitter, Discord, Telegram) are great for quick chats or broad conversations ‚Äî but they often get noisy, scattered, or full of low-quality signals.

I‚Äôm building a tool specifically for traders and investors who want focused, private discussions ‚Äî around markets like stocks, crypto, forex, and commodities.

The idea is to allow users to:  
‚Ä¢ Share insights and strategies in private channels  
‚Ä¢ Access premium content from experienced contributors  
‚Ä¢ Reward those who share quality info (in USDC, not just likes)

My main goal is to create a space where serious market participants can exchange ideas **without the noise** and get rewarded fairly for valuable content.

Before going further, I‚Äôd love to ask:  
Would you personally find a platform like this useful?  
What kind of features would make you want to use it?  
What‚Äôs currently missing from platforms you already use?

Any feedback or thoughts are welcome ‚Äî especially from those who actively trade or invest.  
I‚Äôm happy to answer questions and refine the concept based on what the community actually needs."

Notcoin says tap-to-earn ‚Äòprobably dead‚Äô as Telegram games see shift,0,1kf6xxc,https://cointelegraph.com/news/notcoin-telegram-gaming-tap-to-earn-dead-token2049,6,2025-05-05 03:58:23,"Good news.

Notcoin co-founder Vladimir Plotvinov told Cointelegraph that the tap-to-earn gaming era has come to a close as developers focus on creating fun games.

Notcoin, one of the most prominent Web3 gaming projects of 2024, said the tap-to-earn genre is ‚Äúprobably dead‚Äù as Web3 gaming shifts to more fun and engaging projects.

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for Not Games, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 

Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different game genres as tap-to-earn failed to sustain players‚Äô interests. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they‚Äôre not sustainable,‚Äù he said. 

Gamers want a ‚Äúfun time‚Äù with friends 
In 2024, Notcoin was one of Telegram‚Äôs most popular tap-to-earn games, onboarding more than 30 million users within three months of its release. In a previous interview, Sasha attributed the game‚Äôs growth to its ability to ‚Äúsolve the issue‚Äù of onboarding Telegram users into crypto. 

While Telegram gaming exploded in 2024, gamers soon went game-hopping, moving to other games as soon as they ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù what they could in one project. Sasha told Cointelegraph: 

‚ÄúUsers who come to farm ‚Äî their motivation is just to earn something. And with games, it‚Äôs more like I have fun, I want to play with my friends, and I want to play within a group.‚Äù

He added that while Telegram‚Äôs first wave of games didn‚Äôt provide that social element, Web3 can still play a vital role in the platform‚Äôs gaming ecosystem.

He told Cointelegraph that Telegram games started to shift to models that move away from simply ‚Äúfarming‚Äù tokens. In these new experiences, the Web3 economy part becomes an ‚Äúadd-on‚Äù instead of the main value proposition. 

However, development may take some time. Sasha told Cointelegraph that Telegram has no ‚Äúreal games‚Äù yet, but is optimistic for the future.

How artificial intelligence improves Web3 gaming development
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that artificial intelligence and Telegram have made creating games easier for Web3 developers. 

The Notcoin co-founder said that the advent of AI technology allowed developers to be faster and more efficient when writing game code:

‚ÄúIt saves time. My speed of delivery becomes faster. I write code faster than usual because I save a lot of time on other easy tasks.‚Äù

However, he urged developers to pay attention when using AI when creating their projects. 

‚ÄúYou have to pay a lot of attention, have the expertise and experience because you have to see like how the API will work, how it will be connected to each other, how it will work on high load with a lot of users,‚Äù Vladimir said. 

Telegram Web3 gaming to grow exponentially
When asked if Telegram‚Äôs Web3 gaming industry will still grow despite the perceived death of tap-to-earn, Salo told Cointelegraph that Telegram has a market similar to Facebook and WeChat, which are platforms with their own gaming ecosystems. 

‚ÄúWe believe in our chances because we already have a similar platform like WeChat and Facebook that already have their game ecosystems, and it‚Äôs a huge market. The number of users is practically the same,‚Äù she said. 

Salo noted that Telegram‚Äôs gaming scene currently lacks major publishers and investor funding, but she expects exponential growth.

Salo added that they‚Äôre trying to get to a point where gamers play not just to get tokens but because it‚Äôs fun. ‚ÄúWe're trying to get this extra part, like this ‚Äòfun‚Äô with something that people are doing not only for money, just for themselves,‚Äù Salo said.

Quantum-Resistant Cryptography updates,23,1kela5j,https://coinmarketcap.com/view/quantum-resistant/,20,2025-05-04 09:36:10,"Quantum resistance is quickly moving from being a ""category"" or ""narrative"" to being a requirement ALL chains are trying to prepare and solve for.

You have seen ETH, SOL, ADA, HBAR, ALGO, and many more start to talk about the pieces they may have in place, or their 3 year plans to deliver the necessary upgrade.    
  
Why is Post Quantum Cryptography necessary?  Unfortunately, despite all the damage control out there, the risk exists that today's cryptography will be broken.  The reason ETH and ADA acknowledge 3 year plans is they know this is not a simple solution.  It will be disruptive and is not exciting or value added- it takes away from building other things.

Meanwhile, there are a handful of projects that started building years ago.

QRL delivered their PQC chain 7 years ago.  3 years ago they embarked on offering evm compatibility and moving to PoS.  This upgrade, called Zond, looks to be nearing completion.  There was some discussion of a recent exchange unloading tokens, but they look to have recovered from that.

QANX has been working on their full product for 4+ years.  It has aimed to deliver a product that can leverage the ethereum ecosystem while still signing with quantum resistance.  They also have aimed to make this the most business/developer friendly chain they can imagine.  Currently in 5th month of mainnet audit- and the quiet wait has left the price bleeding.  This is the project that I began following years ago and remain a holder as I am interested in seeing blockchain deliver business value.  They recently announced a partnership with IBM which leads me to believe they are on their way to delivering their vision.

CELL has been quiet lately- I haven't seen much going on.

As for BTC, the conversations have been progressing.  There is at least one BIP being discussed, but like the other large altcoins, this is a major challenge that will take time to deliver an acceptable solution with consensus.

I am new to crypto trading and I am looking to learn how to correctly analyse and try to predict the market.

Therefore, I am looking for a community (maybe on this subreddit, maybe on Discord or anywhere else), where people post screenshots of their analysis of a coin and whether they go long or short, when they would do it and why, what their TP and SL would be, ... so other people can discuss if they agree or not.

I feel like this would be a great place to learn how other traders think.

Also, I live in Belgium and I'm not really sure what app to use. Currently I use Bitvavo because if I deposit money on there, it gets transferred instantly. But I feel like Bitvavo lacks a lot of coins.

Thank you for your time and help!"

I am a maxi bitcoiner and I am having a discussion with a close friend. My friend is convinced a certain Blockchain technology, specifically Chainlink will help connect BTC to RWA and everything else that exist that can be tokenized and whatever. Connecting it to stocks, and creating new financial instruments if I'm understanding correctly. Thus increasing the price of BTC and Chainlink.

Again I am fully onboard with BTC and don't trust coins with executive teams/premines since they are typically just dilution scams. Chainlink does seem to have a proper gaining network and a maximum supply locked in a smart contact.  It's been hitting roadmap milestones, having huge conferences with big money institutions and yadayada.

I am skeptical of his position and I just want to know from someone else who has maybe done the research here. Is Chainlink really a benefit to BTC? Can BTCs growing network eventually achieve what Chainlink is attempting to do? Will it just fade away into irrelevance like most cryptos?
 If you have done research connecting the two and understand what I am asking please share with me! I am looking for any insight to further my understanding here.

Thanks for reading And appreciate any feedback "

I then use Cakewallet to exchange the LTC for Monero (they keep transaction records including info about the LTC and XMR address and input).

I then buy a few things using the same Monero from another person (so a few transactions on the chain).

This person gets compromised (PC/XMR wallet confiscated).

How hard would it be for the people who have the confiscated wallet to de-anonymize this customer?  If they look at the blockchain and they see transactions involving the confiscated wallet, would they not see the rings with all the potential TXID's of the customer? If they looked at these transactions for recurring TXIDs (the customer bought things multiple times), couldn't they assume that the recurring TXID was the actual TXID being used to send monero to the stealth address by another individual (the customer)?

They could then sweep all the known exchanges for info regarding transactions involving this specific TXID and find the LTC-to-Monero exchange ID, which would lead them back to the last person to buy the LTC before that, which of course is linked to the KYC exchange it came from."

Looking at certain APYs and such, and some just seem insane... My typical savings account gives me at minimum 2% a year return, at incredibly low risk with no concern for real capital loss. The 2% I get through this seems absolutely miniscule when I look at some of these insane APY's some of these projects are offering. Just take eTukTuk for example... they are offering 30,000% presale staking reward... like what the hell?! How is that even possible? To me, this screams something that is too good to be true. Another one, Bitcoin Minetrix, is offering 500%... Both of these coins are in presale... is this just something that should scream scam? Lol. Some other staking options are much more realistic, but still offer well more than the 2% my savings account is accruising...

  
My question to you all... what are the risks here? I am going to assume the risks are the coin dumping in value and your savings disappear or lose a crap ton of value that never makes up for the insane APY they're offering... But 30,000% APY seems ridiculous. Are the majority of these scams? Something like Aptos is 14.6% though and that's a legit project...

European Union to ban anonymous crypto and privacy tokens by 2027,286,1kcyze5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-crypto-ban-anonymous-privacy-tokens-2027,200,2025-05-02 06:49:46,"> Europe will ban anonymous crypto accounts and privacy coins starting in 2027 under sweeping new AML regulations targeting service providers and token anonymity.

> The European Union is set to impose sweeping Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules that will ban privacy-preserving tokens and anonymous cryptocurrency accounts from 2027.

> Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

> ‚ÄúArticle 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,‚Äù according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI).

> The regulation is part of a broader AML framework that includes bank and payment accounts, passbooks and safe-deposit boxes, ‚Äúcrypto-asset accounts allowing anonymisation of transactions,‚Äù and ‚Äúaccounts using anonymity-enhancing coins.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe regulations (the AMLR, AMLD and AMLAR) are final, and what remains is the ‚Äòfine print‚Äô ‚Äî aka the interpretation of some of the requirements through the so-called implementing and delegated acts,‚Äù according to Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the EUCI.

> She added that much of the implementation will come through so-called implementing and delegated acts, which are mostly handled by the European Banking Authority:

> ‚ÄúThis means that the EUCI is still actively working on these level two acts by providing feedback to the public consultations, as some of the implementation details are yet to be finalized.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúHowever, the broader framework is final, so centralized crypto projects (CASPs under MiCA) need to keep it in mind when determining their internal processes and policies,‚Äù Savova said.

> EU to increase oversight of crypto service providers
Under the new regulatory framework, CASPs operating in at least six member states will be under direct AML supervision.

> In the initial stage, AMLA plans to select 40 entities, with at least one entity per member state, according to EUCI‚Äôs AML Handbook. The selection process is set to start on July 1, 2027.

I think people close to me might be responsible,0,1ke7f5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ke7f5h/i_think_people_close_to_me_might_be_responsible/,24,2025-05-03 19:34:26,"A few weeks ago I found that I could not access my main account. No email notification about why, nothing.

It was a shock but I tried not to panic, slowly going over stuff only to notice a certain document missing from one of my google accounts. 

To explain, I have a Close Family Member who I adore. She is someone that invested with me years ago. This CFM approached last year and said she was worried that if something happened to me that she would need to be able to access her assets. I showed her the live accounts and how to access them it but she wanted it written down and I caved. I gave her the info she needed to get access to my computer, my phone and Gmail account and on the Gmail account I included all the information you could use including master keys‚Ä¶

About a third of her crypto and a small amount from the rest of my family were on another account that I don‚Äôt think I wrote the master key for but everything else of hers and everything I had was compromised.

These past few weeks were.. tough. Constant invasive thoughts, the worst kind, I felt like I was on autopilot. I couldn‚Äôt do anything I tried looking through the accounts more, see if I could find anything. There were more deleted things and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing emails I could have sworn I had but I was just kind of numb. Everything I had was in there. It's not just about the money, I have dreams of a big family and.. I tried to act normal, but people around me knew something was wrong, my mom especially.

I give occasional reports to CFM and she has been asking for one. So I went to her house this last Thursday and broke down. She handled it well enough. She said she had spoken to my parents a few days before and she mentioned to them that she guessed it was bitcoin related. 

We went to tell my folks and I‚Äôm so thankful for family, you know. Love them to bits.

We talked a lot. She said that she would put me in touch with a Family Friend. It‚Äôs someone I‚Äôve met twice before but I‚Äôve heard great things about him.

He messaged me and said he wasn‚Äôt the most knowledgeable, but I know he‚Äôs a smart guy and works with software and was told he has crypto himself.

So we had a meeting.

I‚Äôm doubting myself now as I write this.¬†

I‚Äôm sure I explained what I think happened, about a Gmail hack, or losing master keys.

I told him how I had contacted support though I‚Äôm still waiting for an answer.
¬†
But we avoided talking about that and started talking about the structure of my accounts. And some of the details for the account that wasn‚Äôt hacked.

He mentioned to me that the account could be closed because of a compliance issue. 

I don‚Äôt know, my head turned off then. I didn‚Äôt want to overthink it. Lost master keys do not mean that everything might be ok. Your master keys go missing and things have happened in your account and the problem is compliance? 

Later that afternoon I talked to my CFM again, and she said how good he is and how important it is to trust him. How it‚Äôll be good to get a third party look at it. 

I just needed some space, and I mentioned to my folks that I was going over to a friend‚Äôs house. I haven‚Äôt known him long, but I meet him every few weeks and he also works with software. She overheard me say this and told me not to say anything to him, how he‚Äôs not someone you can trust so I shouldn‚Äôt talk to him about this.

I talked anyway. He called a friend and put him on speaker. They were extremely levelheaded and patient and after hearing this they came to their own conclusions and now I‚Äôm making this post because I need to know if I‚Äôm going crazy.

I spoke to CFM again this morning. She emphasized how much trust she had in FF and how good this would be and that I should listen to him. She said she was going to push me, be on my case. That it‚Äôll be good for us.

Later today I got an email from her about what her and FF talked about and contains the following:

How we need to get the wallet address to know if it was a hack (which I don‚Äôt have).

That the timing seems like it could be for non-compliance. Big exchanges are getting regulated.

That the account could be closed because you can‚Äôt have more than one (you can?).

How I must give him an API key (he mentioned read only in our meeting, trying to give him the benefit of the doubt)

This family friend needs to see my emails to check.

Explains that this might be a long drawn out process (then why do I feel like I‚Äôm being made to hurry?).

And finally if none of that works then there is an option, ‚Äúwhich of course you need to consider‚Äù, that I give everything to him, all login details and passwords (that I have changed since the hack) related to all accounts that I have and all crypto accounts which would include 2fa so that he can take a quick look into it and it would not take long for him to find out what happened.

I don‚Äôt want to believe this. I want to be told that I‚Äôm just being paranoid. I know paranoia is closely related to suicidal thoughts or breakdowns but isn‚Äôt this just.. what is this. I don‚Äôt know what to think or do. I‚Äôm afraid and confused."
Crypto Users lose Millions by using Crypto exchange Changelly,86,1kd2541,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kd2541/crypto_users_lose_millions_by_using_crypto/,42,2025-05-02 09:20:17,"A simple search of Changelly on Reddit will have you come across thousands of posts and comments on how the cryptocurrency exchange scams its users and how it lies.

Users have lost as much as 30BTC and $5 Million using Changelly with Changelly using the judistiction of St Vincent and Grenadines as an excuse to safeguard itself and to continue scamming.

The TrustPilot of Changelly is no better. Trustpilot shows users leaving 1\* reviews on how they have been scammed counter attacked by fake 5\* reviews to balance it. A simple review of all the 5\* reviews will make you realise 90% of them have nothing to do with crypto.

Changelly claims it has moved to SVG from Hong Kong in 2019 yet a simple Wayback search reveals they were in Hong Kong according to there own Terms of Service for at least 2021 why would a large crypto exchange company lie?

The head of this operation is Jake Cormack a british Citizen living in Hong Kong with ties to Chiron, RichDestiny and Coin360 a known scammer in the crypto space.

I urge everyone to be very careful when exchange tokens and avoid using Changelly.

Following story is my interpretation of events, the protocol seemed to work fine for as long as I've used it. I've only put limited amounts of money in (<‚Ç¨500) and I've got most of it out already so it doesn't look like a scam at first. I believe it also runs deeper than my story but I just got out and I'm not looking back anymore.

TL;DR Discord mods Synfuture tried to blatantly scam me.



Here goes:  
Synfutures (F) is a perpetual future contract trading protocol, allowing to go long or short on a variety of crypto coins. It was interesting to me as I am European and don't have access to Binance perpetuals (as an example).

My issue was that in order to close a position I had to always make a market order, not ideal. I went to the discord of Synfutures - General Chat and asked for advice if anyone has another way. The discord channel is kept clean with very limited organic conversations (first red flag). Usually only mods answer and not many people seem to be actively taking part in conversations. Mods usually refer the individual asking a question to open a ticket with their support ticket system, to get them out of the public eye. Afterwards, posting some links about the protocol to boost their own validity as mod.

First image is me posting the original question, getting a response from an moderator ""impersonator"" less than one minute after I posed my question. It is not the original reply, as I didn't see any need to screenshot it at start.

[https://imgur.com/a/FcaFTve](https://imgur.com/a/FcaFTve)

  
So I DM this guy (this is where I started to pick up on the red flags). And express this concern to him.  
[https://imgur.com/a/qkyYQnU](https://imgur.com/a/qkyYQnU)  


I do make a ticket afterwards, in the hopes of getting a different moderator (hoping it's an isolated case). Note: the initial messages how quick they were, and when I didn't buy it their responses took multiple hours.

Changed profile name etc of the original reply.

Additional, same MO with others I think:  
[https://imgur.com/a/ud8LAAH](https://imgur.com/a/ud8LAAH)

  
I'm not saying the protocol is a scam, but honestly it could be imo. I'm not saying everyone at Synfutures is a scammer, though it could be all and the same person. But this was so weird for no reason, as I was just asking for a basic feature of the protocol and it turned out like this. Up until then I was very enthusiastic about Synfutures, but yeah now I took my money out and I'm not looking back.

  
Keep yourself safe hombres."

Ethereum is inherently more scalable than Web2,0,1kdpl0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kdpl0b/ethereum_is_inherently_more_scalable_than_web2/,8,2025-05-03 05:10:09,"**Ethereum is the first system where the capacity to grow isn't bottlenecked by centralized teams or a locked-in feature set, and this makes it inherently more scalable than Web2.**

To elaborate: Ethereum is the first political system that is fully formalized ‚Äî and therefore mechanically enforced ‚Äî and whose rulebook is general-purpose. Like Bitcoin, anyone can join, validate, or transact without approval ‚Äî rules are code, enforcement is consensus. But because Ethereum‚Äôs rulebook is general-purpose, i.e. its execution environment is Turing-complete, anyone can also introduce new functionality without a hard fork. So permissionlessness applies not only to *who* participates, but also to *what* can be built ‚Äî creating a scaling mechanism with a fully open supply curve, inherently resistant to the platform lock-in and ecosystem capture that dominate Web2 markets.

**MegaETH is the first implementation to prove what that dual permissionlessness means in practice: Web2 speeds and throughput, without surrendering trustlessness.** And matching Web2 is only the beginning.

‚úÖ **Why Web3 lagged**: Ethereum has to reach cryptographic consensus, so its base layer trades raw speed for trust. And early on, it hadn't yet developed its modular system design to scale beyond that base layer. Monolithic chains that tried to outscale Ethereum squeezed out a few thousand TPS by centralizing hardware or nodes ‚Äî but they ran into a ""single-vendor"" wall: one sequencer, one data pipeline, one team scaling the stack.

‚úÖ **Why this changes with MegaETH**: Execution, data availability, and consensus are modular, and cryptoeconomically secured by Ethereum. Anyone who restakes ETH can spin up extra capacity ‚Äî no permission, no bespoke validator set, full Ethereum security. In practice that means:

‚Ä¢ 1.7 Ggas/s (‚âà130M tx/day) already proven on public testnet

‚Ä¢ 15 MB/s of data availability live (road-mapped to 1 GB/s)

‚Ä¢ <10 ms block times and sub-$0.0001 fees even at today‚Äôs gas price

‚Ä¢ A full node still runs on hardware as lean as a $180 ARM board, so hobbyists can verify the chain ‚Äî decentralization isn‚Äôt sacrificed for speed.

‚úÖ **Why this beats cloud-scale**: Web2 performance is limited by the capital budgets of a handful of cloud or payment giants (Visa‚Äôs theoretical max ~65k TPS). Web3 with open supply curves has the internet effect: more providers join ‚Üí capacity rises ‚Üí unit cost falls ‚Üí better UX ‚Üí more users ‚Üí more fees ‚Üí even more providers. Closed systems can‚Äôt spin that flywheel.

‚úÖ **Why devs care right now**: MegaMafia 2.0 wraps that infra edge in YC-style support ‚Äî up-front grants, product/security mentors, and cohort cross-promo to live users.

**So the ceiling isn‚Äôt ""match Web2"". Ethereum‚Äôs architecture always pointed beyond it. MegaETH is just the first implementation proving the math. If you‚Äôre building something that should still be fast ‚Äî and verifiable ‚Äî five years from now, this is where you plant your flag.**"

I tried to prove that MicroStrategy was a better buy than Bitcoin... here's what I learned!,52,1kcpums,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kcpums/i_tried_to_prove_that_microstrategy_was_a_better/,70,2025-05-01 21:02:44,"I set out with the hypothesis that ""MicroStrategy is a better buy than Bitcoin.""

I didn't necessarily believe that, but I wanted to try to prove it, against my bias.

I compared MSTR with 4 of the darling Bitcoin Mining Companies, and measured how much Bitcoin I was acquiring per share of each company.

https://preview.redd.it/omskjmciz9ye1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=cab16758971f662edf4597e14f7745fdeacb7c66

I then compared the cost of bitcoin to the cost of their shares, and normalized each companies share value to the # of shares required to be equal $-cost to me as an investor.

And then took the difference between the cost of investing in their company, versus the cost of just buying bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/tjezakxkz9ye1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c38f09dddee61fecaed7c965f86de558fd5cad4

Marathon Digital was the only compelling option. Costing just a $9 premium against the amount of Bitcoin you get per share.

But that's not the whole story.

I then considered each companies Debt, and how much of the total value of their company they owe in debt.

And since their entire game is buying or mining bitcoin, I checked their Debt-to-Bitcoin ratio as well.

https://preview.redd.it/937r6qznz9ye1.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=be777597e05ac0f0cfe3b5e291afbefcd8735e14

Marathon, which could break even on share:bitcoin ratio in just a few days of bitcoin growth... would nevertheless still owe almost half of that value in debt!!

https://preview.redd.it/0zh6o4uqz9ye1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb7dfb219030c48fe9afb1ebfcc0abfbc3fd7949

THEREFORE. As these companies must continue spending money to acquire bitcoin, it is natural that they will continue to amass debt, or have to earn money to pay it back, or have to sell bitcoin to pay it back...

It may be the case that the real value of these companies lies in market psychology, and the potential for leveraged returns vs. bitcoin.

But real/true value... Bitcoin wins, unless these companies generate cashflow through another means beyond Bitcoin, which can be used to pay off debts, to right the bitcoin:share ratio for the investor.

Have I proven that these stocks do NOT represent the value that purchasing Bitcoin directly does?

What mistakes did I make? Thanks for helping!"

Aztec L2 Public Testnet is live,4,1kcwahz,https://aztec.network/blog/a-new-era-for-web3-introducing-aztec-public-testnet,3,2025-05-02 03:55:35,
Exodus Wallet - All My Crypto Hacked & Stolen.,60,1kcfrfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kcfrfa/exodus_wallet_all_my_crypto_hacked_stolen/,89,2025-05-01 13:21:56,"

I use Exodus Wallet and have used them for a couple of years. My 12 word seed phrase is written down and in a fireproof safe. I do not have it saved anywhere on my PC. Exodus also asks for a password (though I know this is local only - anytime I open it). No one has been on my computer or in my house with any access to this other than myself.

I don't know where else to go for help. I realize that it's a slim to none chance I'll ever see my at the time $47K worth of BTC again. I posted this on Exodus Wallet and some other reddit forums but it keeps getting taken down. At the very least this should serve as a warning to others using Exodus Wallet (especially without a Trezor or some such linked to your Exodus wallet).

If I am not allowed to post details such as the transaction ID and the Wallet address that my BTC was transferred to then I apologize, a MOD can hopefully edit that out instead of delete my post. My hope is that maybe the thief will slip up and send it to a KYC exchange. Though, I'm still not sure of recovery chances if that occurs. I worked hard for this half a BTC and I am still in shock, I know time will heal all things but it has been a rough couple of days. This is a throw away reddit account because I am frankly ashamed and embarrassed that this occurred.

On April 28th around 2:20pm I had a malware infection which I discovered fairly quickly. I noticed my mouse cursor had the loading circle next to it repeating itself over and over... So I checked task manager and there was a program called ""Azubuy"" which I never saw before. I then shortly after saw ""Opera"" browser and ""Anydesk"" open up (neither installed on my machine and Anydesk sent big red flags because it's remote access). I cancelled all 3 of these from task manager and deleted their directories as well. I then went into startup programs and saw like 30 entries of ""Azubuy"" and turned them all off and restarted my PC.

When my PC booted back up Azubuy was again in my task manager. So I decided then to just format and reinstall Windows. I had backups of everything elsewhere and thought this is the best way to ensure whatever is going on is eliminated.

While Windows was now reinstalling I got an alert on my phone that someone was trying to get into my Gmail but 2FA thwarted it. An IP address from some ip address in Oklahoma. So that prompted me to check other things and when I loaded my Exodus app on my phone my heart sank as I saw all my BTC sent to some wallet I know nothing about. Looks like that wallet has accumulated over 3 BTC now and I'm not some amazing block chain forensic analyst but I'm sure they are going to want to cash that out somehow somewhere.

I know I clearly created the opportunity here for this by not having a Trezor and also getting malware'd. But hell how did they get my seed phrase for my Exodus wallet, isn't it encrypted even though it's stored locally on my PC? This all happened in less than 5 minutes mind you. I'd of been safer leaving my crypto in Coinbase at least I'd of had 2FA like on my Gmail. Live and learn... Any help or advice is GREATLY appreciated.

Apparently I can't post transaction or wallet ID's here - but I am willing to get them to anyone that thinks they can help me trace things.

Last week we saw some of the biggest inflows in ETF from the start. But they were all concentrated in a single ETF, in fact, the other ETFs were experiencing outflows. What is it that makes Blackrock go completely against the stream? I heard some ideas that Tether was funneling funds through MSTR and Blackrocks ETF, are we seeing a massive scale compound leverage on Bitcoin through ETF's, shares in MSTR and spot Bitcoins? I fail to find any reasoning for this other than Blackrock is in a different game than the other ETFs, but what could that be?

Chainlink Just Dropped Payment Abstraction on Mainnet - LINK Fee Conversion is Live!,24,1kcbs4s,https://i.redd.it/sc9d4xw1x6ye1.jpeg,7,2025-05-01 10:38:15,"This feature basically means that fees paid to use Chainlink services can now be automatically converted into LINK. This includes stuff like Chainlink‚Äôs Subscription Verifiable Randomness (SVR) that is used by a lot of protocols including Aave.

This feels like a sneaky big move that will fly under the radar for most of people but it could seriously boost LINK demand over time translating into more usage = more fees = more LINK being bought, burned or held by node operators depending how it is structured.

This feature it also makes Chainlink services smoother to use making dApps dont have to worry about holding LINK directly to pay for stuff, Chainlink directly handles the conversion and this is huge for adoption.

For those loving tech and enjoying it you can read the whole feature documentation here¬†[https://blog.chain.link/payment-abstraction-svr-fee-conversion/](https://blog.chain.link/payment-abstraction-svr-fee-conversion/)

Chainlink is definitely one of those strong projects that keep working in the shadows without making a lot of noise but really providing real use of cases and utilities that improves Ethereum ecosystem a lot. A safe bet if I am honest.

Since it's only a couple hundred bucks, obviously I'd be looking at things that are very low in price but have the potential to really pop when/if we get a vigorous altcoin season. Something that is priced only a few cents currently, but might run up in a 20X, 30X, or more.

For example, one I just looked at but then rejected was Casper (CSPR). It is around $0.01 and is being hyped by some pundits as something that might go to $1.00 or $2.00, but I looked into it and as soon as I found it has no maximum supply, I was turned off completely.   
  
I'd like to hear what some of you would mention as things that are in that kind of price range (let's say less than $0.05) and that you feel has the potential to go nuts in the altcoin season (provided we get one).

I'm really only interested in utility tokens for projects that will actually do something and have the promise of playing a role in the new system. I'm not interested in meme coins at all. Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Hardware Wallet? advice.,0,1kcdejj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kcdejj/hardware_wallet_advice/,6,2025-05-01 11:44:52,"My first hardware wallet was a **Ledger Nano X**, but since I usually **buy and hold long-term**, I didn‚Äôt use it often. Over time, I started having **battery issues**, especially during charging, and eventually struggled to access my crypto because of it.

So I switched to a **Tangem 2-card setup**. Long story short: I forgot my **PIN** and hid the **second card** (needed for PIN reset) *so well* that I can‚Äôt find it.

Now I‚Äôm about to switch to a new phone, and **transferring the Tangem app requires the PIN**. I still have **full access on my current phone** (via the app + fingerprint), so I know I need to **move my crypto soon**.

My question:  
Should I just buy a new **Tangem 3-card pack**? Or would I be better off switching to something like the **Trezor Safe 5**? I liked Tangem's simplicity and the fact that I didn‚Äôt need to write down a 24-word seed phrase ‚Äî but losing the cards feels **too risky** now.

In Q3 2022, almost 100% were hiking rates, crushing risk assets. But the tide is turning...

JY's secret weapon? **Draining $2.5T from the reverse repo program, effectively re-leveraging the financial system.** Gold went from 2k-ish to 3.5k-ish. Bitcoin went from 15k-ish to $100k-ish as a result.

Key metric to watch: The **MOVE Index. When it hits 140, policy makers WILL step in and pump liquidity**. It's like a financial bat signal.

US deficit is already tracking 22% higher this fiscal year. Biden, Trump - doesn't matter. **The spending machine keeps rolling.**

**Foreign sovereigns are getting nervous.** After Russia's treasury seizure, **countries are buying gold instead of US bonds. Trust is eroding.**

**The banking system is constrained by Basel III regulations. Commercial banks can't just buy treasuries like before.** Something's gotta give.

**Buybacks are the new ""not-quantitative easing"" - a clever way to inject liquidity without calling it money printing.** Wall Street's magic trick!

**US tax receipts are dropping. Stock market down = less capital gains. The system is running on fumes.**

**Political reality: No politician can cut Social Security, Medicare, or defense.** These are third rail issues that guarantee continued spending.

**US-China tensions + mid-term election next year = guaranteed money printing**. **Politicians will do ANYTHING to create an illusion of economic strength.**

Beware of the web 3 game Drakthos. I was messaged by a guy on X about a game. I‚Äôve been messaged these things before and always know it‚Äôs bs. But I got curious. Instead of clicking his links he sent I went the long way. Found their discord joined naturally.,25,1kbsswg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbsswg,17,2025-04-30 17:05:41,"5 years in crypto. I have been pretty good at identifying, helping and avoiding links, scam people, wallet drains etc. 

Photos for evidence of person

To be clear. None of my wallets were breached. My emails are safe. I have 2 factor on them plus 2 factor on my coinbase and anything important. None of these were compromised thankfully. Before I even tried this, I deleted all my wallets off my PC and moved all my funds to brand new wallets on a second phone I have at home, just because you never know in this space. So anything that would happen, no worries clean my pc, update scans etc.

I‚Äôm always weary so the links he sent for the game I did not click. I went to the main x acct, joined their discord. 

7k ppl on there. All seemed normal. Game is in pre beta lots of testing and people just asking questions, reporting bugs etc. so I clicked the official links game went to their website. All normal no weird stuff.

Then the game wouldn‚Äôt exactly download. It froze over and over and when I got to actually have the pop up where it says play, the loading bar gets stuck 75% thru. 

According to others only a handful of ppl said had same issue. Everyone else have been playing the game and just reporting feedback.

The guy who invited me was being very late on responses. They did a maintenance update and then he told me keep trying. Nothing worked.
Still get stuck at loading bar at 75%. 

2 days of this. 
This morning I was removed from the discord. Banned. I made new discord rejoined and complained. Instant ban. Then found out the original guy who messaged me on X, his acct was suspended. Shoulda been a red flag.

I go to my x acct. and there it is. Email changed and it‚Äôs a new name. Same username so they didn‚Äôt change that. Somehow they changed the email and phone number linked and I didn‚Äôt receive any notification. 
All they got was my x acct. luckily. 

I updated all my passwords and double checked all my 2 factors. All good. Then ran a malware scan.
For the first time in a year. It found 3 new threats. Coding was for a Trojan, ransomeare worm, etc it had a list of what they‚Äôre all called.
I quarantined them. Updated my subscription. Removed any weird files, found none. The game itself wasn‚Äôt even a file download. More like a temporary installer that doesn‚Äôt stay to your pc. 

Idk how they got my x acct but that‚Äôs all they got. Posting this as a warning. Not for sympathy, who cares I lost an x acct. I‚Äôve made a dozen by now. What‚Äôs a new one going to hurt?

Discord guy was name daan he was
 confounder apparently. 

 Stay safe out there bloods.

How do you automate crypto trades without losing your mind?,2,1kc3xc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kc3xc8/how_do_you_automate_crypto_trades_without_losing/,26,2025-05-01 03:41:11,"I‚Äôve been trading crypto on and off for a couple of years, mostly setting limit orders on DEXs and CEXs, but lately I‚Äôm itching to automate more of it. I‚Äôm talking about small wins of one to three percent per trade and scaling up when it makes sense. Right now my manual trades hit maybe 60 percent of the time and my average profit per successful trade is about 1.8 percent after fees.

I gave a bot a try recently ‚Äî I used Banana Gun bot for a few weeks, ran ten snipes and got six winners but had four failed transactions that cost me around two dollars each in gas. My net profit was only about three percent overall, so I pulled back. It felt like a lot of babysitting anyway, adjusting gas price and dealing with slippage.

I‚Äôm curious what other people are doing for real on-chain automation. Do you run your own scripts on a VPS or use a service? What kind of success rates do you see and how do you protect yourself from failed transactions or MEV front-runs? How do you balance the cost of gas or RPC calls with tiny profit margins?

Would love to hear about your setups, the actual numbers you hit, and which tools or strategies you trust to keep your wins ahead of your costs."

The World's Largest Asset Manager (BlackRock) Files To Tokenize $150B Money Market Fund Shares,292,1kb9ekn,https://i.redd.it/5vd0oriywwxe1.jpeg,59,2025-04-30 00:59:48,"BlackRock just took another step forward into the blockchain world by filing for the creation of a new class of digital shares (DLT Shares) for its massive $150 billion money market fund. These shares will be recorded using blockchain technology with the goal for more transparent and efficient ownership tracking.

This is not just another experiment, it is the world's largest asset manager signaling loud and clear that tokenization of tradicional assets is no longer a theoretical concept and they already proved it with BUILD, their tokenized fund on Ethereum for Real World Assets (RWAs). And guess what, it is very probably that they will use Ethereum for this too.

Ethereum has proven smart contract infrastructure, robust developer ecosystem and growing support for enterprise apps. Ethereum is the no brain choice to build on in a easy and secure way. Taking in count as I said that BlackRock is already working on Ethereum, it is pretty obvious that the easy choice is Ethereum because they already have their developers trained to work with Ethereum so this makes future developments easier to do. When a company choose a tech, they use to keep building on it and only change if things are really bad. If not, always the easy, fast and cheaper way and in this case its Ethereum.

Ethereum is the future of finance.

Is there any real use of World (WLD) right now?,0,1kcjgcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kcjgcs/is_there_any_real_use_of_world_wld_right_now/,16,2025-05-01 15:58:04,"I'm following World (WLD) for almost a year, and I see Orbs are popping up in Latin America (obviously looking for myself) but they're all over the world at this point.

For those who don't know, Worldcoin gives you a [World](https://world.org/) ID after you scan your iris using a device called an Orb. It's supposed to verify that you're a real human and then give you small WLD rewards for being part of the network. It's more simple than it sounds but there are all sorts of opinions about it (including ppl who just don't care).

The idea sounds good on paper because it lets you use digital identity for platforms without needing your personal info, and it could be useful for universal basic income. It can also be used for voting apps, airdrop filters, or login alternatives, so - good potential long-term.

But a lot of people complain about it because you're trading biometric data for coins, and there's not much you can actually do with it right now. Which I guess is fine for those who want long-term investments, but still kinda a red flag for others.

So what do you think? Is anyone here using it or planning to, and is there a point in giving your personal info right now?"

Are on-chain trading bots actually worth it in today‚Äôs crypto market?,22,1kbcef7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kbcef7/are_onchain_trading_bots_actually_worth_it_in/,23,2025-04-30 04:38:40,"I‚Äôve been watching the markets lately and the numbers are wild: Bitcoin sees around $50 billion in daily volume, Ethereum about $25 billion, and even Solana‚Äôs spot volume is pushing $200 million a day. With Ethereum gas fees averaging $5‚Äì$10 per transaction during busy times and Solana‚Äôs usually under a cent, it feels like cost dynamics could really swing in favor of on-chain bots for things like DEX arbitrage and token snipes.

I‚Äôve heard tools like [Banana Gun](https://bananagun.io/) offer quick auto-sniping, limit orders, and MEV-resistant swaps, though I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. There are also frameworks like Hummingbot, Gelato, and various open-source snipers that claim you can net something like 1‚Äì5% returns per month if everything lines up. On the flip side, I‚Äôve seen warnings about front-running, failed-tx fees, and impermanent loss eating into profits.

So here‚Äôs my question: for those of you running bots in DeFi, what has your real-world performance looked like? Any actual numbers on ROI, average TX costs, or win rates? How do you handle failed transactions and gas fees when you‚Äôre chasing small arbitrage windows?

I‚Äôm weighing whether to dedicate 10‚Äì20% of my portfolio to an on-chain bot strategy or just stick to manual orders on CEXs. Would love to hear which bots or frameworks you trust and what benchmarks you‚Äôve hit. Thanks!"

The way they're handling self-custody with recovery is what most normies (and even a lot of us here) have been low-key waiting for. Let‚Äôs be real, most people want control over their funds but don‚Äôt want to stress over seed phrases like it‚Äôs a sacred scroll.

What stood out to me is how DOP is using zero knowledge proofs to recover access without exposing your keys. That‚Äôs wild. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre blending the security of cold wallets with the convenience of Web2 logins, and I‚Äôm not mad about it.

Also, the fact that they‚Äôre giving users an actual Web3 ID that carries across platforms?  Imagine logging into dApps or exchanges without doing the ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù song and dance every time. If this scales well, it could seriously clean up the UX mess that‚Äôs holding crypto adoption back.

Still early, obviously, and I want to see how they handle exploits or black swan events, but this is the kind of innovation crypto needs. Less degen buzz, more real world usability."

Ethereum has far and away the most advanced technology in crypto,345,1kacnlf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kacnlf,488,2025-04-28 20:51:17,"For the outsider who is not well-acquainted with the crypto sector, it may not be obvious ‚Äî given how much marketing hype there is about every blockchain ‚Äî but Ethereum has far and away the most advanced technology in crypto, and any project outside of Ethereum is at best a long-shot fueled by VC ambitions.

Let's go through tangible metrics:

Ethereum mainnet supports 21.3 TPS, and blob-enabled rollups now push that to 125+ TPS ‚Äî all while preserving Ethereum‚Äôs base-layer security and verifiability. No other protocol scales with this level of trustlessness. Competing chains boost TPS by sacrificing verifiability ‚Äî offloading consensus or requiring privileged hardware (see chart below).

The idea that high-TPS chains have ""better tech"" for parallel execution is also outdated. MegaETH ‚Äî a high-performance Ethereum scalability solution ‚Äî brings true parallelism and high throughput to the EVM, secured by ETH via EigenLayer and EigenDA. On execution, MegaETH now outpaces all so-called high-scalability virtual machines (see below). On data availability, EigenDA already exceeds the capacity of every competing DA solution.

When it comes to DeFi security and tooling, the EVM has always been unmatched ‚Äî as Aave founder Stani Kulechov points out in an interview with Laura Shin:

https://unchainedcrypto.com/why-the-founders-of-aave-and-sky-are-still-bullish-on-ethereum-defi/

And on client software, Ethereum leads by a wide margin. No other chain comes close to its level of client diversity ‚Äî a key factor in decentralization and network resilience.

At this point, the EVM and Ethereum stack offer:

‚Ä¢ The most secure virtual machine with the strongest developer tooling

‚Ä¢ The most decentralized and verifiable network architecture

‚Ä¢ The most scalable modular tech stack ‚Äî across execution, settlement, and data availability ‚Äî without compromising decentralization

Despite cutting corners everywhere, other chains cannot come close to Ethereum on any metric."

https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/28/coinbase-targeting-4-8-returns-with-new-bitcoin-yield-fund

I used to allocate to similar yield services until the crypto banking collapse in 2021 saw many platforms fail or suspend withdrawals. Since then regulatory frameworks have tightened and new compliance measures have been introduced. Personally I would consider exploring this strategy for a slice of my portfolio.

Are others here interested in institutional yield offerings at these rates? Do you expect retail equivalents to appear soon or competing products from other providers? How do you balance yield products against staking or long-term holding in today‚Äôs market climate?"

But my question is this: Since it is a fixed, limited asset (21 million supply), shouldn‚Äôt the price rise very noticeably when an enormous purchase is made? For example, Saylor‚Äôs Strategy purchases like 200,000 Bitcoin. That is a gigantic percentage of the market cap. How come the price didn‚Äôt move at all? 

I‚Äôve also noticed other huge acquisitions that don‚Äôt affect the price. In fact, the pumps seem completely random most of the time. They don‚Äôt seem to correspond to supply at all‚Ä¶"

"Safemoon CEO John Karony is facing trial for Wire Fraud, Money Laundering and Securities Fraud in one week. Here's his bullshit argument as to why he's ""innocent"".",92,1ka7cyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ka7cyi/safemoon_ceo_john_karony_is_facing_trial_for_wire/,34,2025-04-28 16:38:06,"In 2021 Safemoon launched and their army of brainlets spammed every corner of the Internet in conjunction with paid-off 'celebrity' endorsements, they managed to capture lightning in a bottle and Safemoon catapulted to an $8 Billion market cap, riding on the promise of a token that cannot be rugpulled because the Liquidity Pool was auto-generating and locked.  

PooCoin, Coffeezilla, teams of Crypto detectives and yours truly spent the next few years determinedly pointing the overzealous Safemoon fanboys to the truth which lay on the Blockchain only to be met with insults, threats and ridicule, and we faced the ultimate vindication in November 2023 when Safemoon CEO John Karony and former CTO Thomas Smith were arrested and charged with Conspiracy to commit Wire Fraud, Securities Fraud and Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering.  

Next week, John Karony goes on trial, up against the Department of Justice which has a 93% conviction rate at trial, who have crafted a watertight case of fraud and deception.  

John Karony loudly proclaims on social media: **[I am innocent. I did not commit fraud.](https://x.com/CptHodl/status/1782096932313440416)**  

But hang on, doesn't the blockchain show him offramping tens of millions of millions of dollars? 

###Let's go over John's various legal defenses:  

##1. Extraterritoriality.  

The extraterritoriality defense was John saying ""[I cannot be charged for these crimes in the US because the alleged acts involve Safemoon, which is a token on the international Binance Smart Chain.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK1XnbuWQAE09Wt?format=png&name=900x900)""  

This attempted defense failed because:  

* Safemoon LLC is a US company
* John Karony is a US citizen
* Numerous harmed investors were US citizens  

**The motion to dismiss charges based on this defense was denied.**  

##2. ""It wasn't me"" 

Even I find this attempted defense hard to believe.  

John's motion to dismiss included this [absolute nugget](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK0hWJlXMAAqTnR?format=png&name=900x900).  

> The Indictment does not allege that Karony participated in, or was aware of, these transactions  

Despite the fact that also in that very same indictment it specifically goes over how [Karony instructed Thomas Smith to remove & divert LP funds and perform market manipulation.
](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK0haleW8AAA6Pk?format=png&name=900x900)  

This was when I knew that John had no chance of wriggling out of the charges if his lawyers were this bad.


**The motion to dismiss charges based on this defense was denied.**  

##3. The Blockchain is public.  

This argument formed when Karony enlisted an alleged ""Blockchain expert"" as an expert witness on his behalf. This ""expert witness"" called Mizrach [stated the following](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhCetuua4AAqfww?format=jpg&name=large):

> ""Any user with access to the internet could have known that not all of the liquidity in the LP pool had been locked and that the Deployer wallet was making withdrawals""  

Let's break down this attempted defense. So Karony & Safemoon get to tell people in black and white:  

[Locked Liquidity Pool = Untouchable and #SAFU](https://x.com/safemoon/status/1373058840376324100)

[Tonight the CEO of #SAFEMOON locks $250 MILLION+ DOLLARS WORTH OF LP](https://x.com/safemoon/status/1384869489376907265)  

Later on, Karony becomes more explicit. [His counsel writes that Safemoon owned all assets in the Liquidity Pool.](https://x.com/live4offrd/status/1906738113776697581/photo/1)  

Karony then becomes [crystal clear](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GpUg8apW8AE-wSu?format=jpg&name=medium)  

**What he is saying here is Safemoon was able to take the Liquidity they promised investors was locked, and sell it to Bitmart, and that that revenue is legitimate and therefore no fraud was committed.**  

You don't need to throw that in to ChatGPT to surmise how fucking dumb that argument is.  

---

The best part is that Karony's defense have repeatedly tried to stall the trial because the Government hasn't handed over blockchain records which allege the fraud. The Government simply responded back with ""It's on the blockchain, which is public!""

---

**The motion to dismiss charges based on this defense was denied.**  

##4. NYC Investors were akin to people trying to buy North Korean Nukes  

You might be forgiven for thinking I've had a seizure at my keyboard. No, no, really. That is an argument Karony put forth in court.  

Let's do a bit of context.  

As the Government is bringing its case in NYC, some of the wording focuses on NYC-based investors. The defense jumped on this because you may remember that Crypto users in NYC faced serious challenges in acquiring Cryptocurrencies, often requiring the use of VPN's to bypass state-level access blocks to sites like Coinbase and Binance.  

This is an **actual quote** from Karony's legal counsel as they try to argue that NYC investors were not 'reasonable' because they used a VPN to purchase Safemoon:  

> The Court should be wary of treating all VPN-acquiring investors as 'reasonable.' The mere fact that residents of New York, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or elsewhere used VPNs to obtain access to a particular investment does not necessarily suggest that the resulting purchases were reasonable. One does not become a 'reasonable investor' in uranium simply by purchasing fissile material from North Korea via VPN.  

Fucking. Insanity.  

**The motion to dismiss charges based on this defense was denied.**    

---

So there you have it. Trial in a week, and John Karony stands alone. His co-conspirator Thomas Smith has flipped against him. His first legal counsel bailed when he ran out of money. His family stand against him after he attempted to sue his own Mother through 22-23.  

And all he has to fall back on are the above extremely flimsy, pithy, substanceless arguments.  

Each charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Realistically, John Karony could be facing 20-25 years behind bars for his crimes."

"Ethereum Ecosystem Smashes New ATH: 15.4M Active Addresses, +62.7% in 7 Days, L2s Dominating",171,1k9qhf7,https://i.redd.it/nvbaai68cjxe1.png,47,2025-04-28 03:20:57,"As you can see in the chart above Ethereum ecosystem just achieved a new ALL TIME HIGH (ATH) with a really big spike. While crypto twitter is busy arguing about meme coins and claiming that Ethereum is dead, Ethereum keeps demonstrating that it is more alive than ever.

It achieved to hit 15.4 Million active addresses, actual users, not just bots or burner wallets. Also a +62.7% surge in active addresses in just 7 days, this is not just growth, this is a full on glow up. Furthermore Layer 2 L2s dominance is at a record of 6.65x, L2s are eating good and scaling dream is real.

While people are saying that Ethereum is dead for the 6940th time, ETH is scaling, thriving and evolving faster than most can keep up. This ecosystem is not just surviving, it is playing a 4D chess while others are stuck checking 2D checkers.

I will repeat it again, we are watching the future of finance and a LOT more being built in front of our eyes. Ignore the noise, ignore the FUD. Stay focused.

Future is bright for Ethereum ecosystem.

I have some Tezos in Guarda wallet, a small amount circa 300.

If I try to send the Tezos to another address I get the error 'failed send tx'

I also get the identical error if I send half the balance, or try converting to another coin, or change the baker.

If I try staking the balance I get the error 'network error'.

I've googled the problem and have seen a number of results but nothing that really helps.

I logged the problem with Guarda support over a week ago but they haven't offered any help yet.

Can anybody offer any help with freeing my Tezos from the clutches of Guarda,

Problem solved thanks to a a response, I used the private key to move the funds to where I wanted them."

The next was ZCash or ZEC. That project is currently at $37.70 with an ATH of $3,191.93. 

What happened to these projects? Are they likely to zero out? That is an absolutely insane price drop. I feel for those of you who are tangled up in projects like that.

Ethereum is macro-evolutionary phenomenon for civilization,5,1k9s32c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k9s32c/ethereum_is_macroevolutionary_phenomenon_for/,54,2025-04-28 05:18:07,"Before Bitcoin, governance was heavily dependent on biological process: opaque intentions, interpreted through lossy human communication, enforced by physical coercion.

Bitcoin introduced the first political system whose governance protocol was fully formalized and automatically executed as public code. It proved that rule enforcement could be detached from subjective human interpretation and enforced mechanically through consensus. By automating enforcement, Bitcoin dramatically lowered the cost of securing a political system and opened direct participation to anyone with a computer. This created a far more resilient foundation.

But Bitcoin formalized a narrow domain: simple monetary transactions and block validation. It was a breakthrough, but a limited one ‚Äî a proof of concept that coordination could be externalized beyond human institutions.

Ethereum extends and completes this foundation. It is the first political system to fully formalize its governance while embedding a general-purpose, programmable rulebook. Any form of human coordination ‚Äî economic, legal, social ‚Äî can now be mediated and enforced automatically by the protocol itself.

Bitcoin was the idea. Ethereum is the execution. Bitcoin showed that sovereignty could be expressed in code. Ethereum made it universal. For the first time in history, the basic foundation of civilization ‚Äî rules, enforcement, coordination ‚Äî can be constructed beyond biological constraint, at the speed and scale of computation."

The arcade setting, along with Web3 leaderboards is a natural fit and has not been properly utilized. 

Another is seamless onboarding for new users through social login without needing to set up a wallet. 

Gaming is such a great use case for the blockchain and I feel it's just a matter of time before the code is cracked and tens of millions of Web2 gamers get onboarded.  

And now for my wall of questions I've been writing down over the past few weeks. Feel free to answer one, a few or all of them!

What excites you most about Web3 games compared to traditional games?

What frustrates you about current Web3 games?

How important is asset ownership to you and do you actually use your NFTs outside of the games?

What would make you stick with a Web3 game long-term?

Have you ever felt a game forced blockchain features on you rather than enhancing your experience?

How do you discover new Web3 games today? (Reddit, Twitter, Discord, friends, launchpads?)

What kind of rewards (tokens, NFTs, real-world prizes) are most valuable to you?

What do you look for in a Web3 game investment: fun first, tokenomics first, community size?

Which trends in Web3 gaming seem overhyped right now and which ones are being overlooked?

How do you evaluate long-term sustainability in play-to-earn or skill-to-earn models?

What metrics matter most to you: daily active players, retention, token velocity, NFT volume?

What would make a Web3 game stand out today in a saturated market?

How do you see the line between games and economies evolving over the next 5 years?

In a perfect world, what would the ideal Web3 gaming experience feel like?

What lessons should Web3 gaming learn from the failures of early Play-to-Earn projects?

How can Web3 games attract ""regular"" gamers who don‚Äôt care about crypto?

What‚Äôs the next killer feature for Web3 gaming that hasn‚Äôt been built yet?"

A few people asked for an update, so here‚Äôs what has happened.

[When I first posted about DELI FM](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k09k23/i_uh_accidentally_made_a_247_crypto_radio_station/)¬†‚Äî the fully autonomous AI-powered crypto radio stream hosted by a sarcastic cardboard box named Buzz Shipmann ‚Äî it was a weird side project to see if AI could run a continuous live media stream without any human intervention.

It started simple:

* Breaking crypto headlines every 90 seconds
* Roasted live by Buzz
* Smooth bossa nova music
* A fake chat that reacts automatically to the news

Now it‚Äôs expanding into a full fictional world.

The stream now broadcasts from the city of Deliverance, Kansas.  
There are live correspondents cutting in with bizarre local news.  
Fake (and real) sponsors advertise products like ""Blockchain Toothpaste"" and ""DeFi Mouthwash.""  
Buzz is still spiraling between serious headlines and complete nonsense.

New features are also being added:

* Listeners will soon be able to trigger events live (make Buzz roast you, change his shirt, make him drink coffee, have a hammer smack him in the head, have items pop out of his head)
* More civic chaos and fake city events are on the way

The stream is still live 24/7, fully autonomous, and weirdly growing.

I will post the link again in the comments if anyone wants to check it out.  
Thanks again for all the support - could not have guessed it would spiral like this. <3"

At the time, those Bitcoins were worth like $41, but today, they‚Äôd be approximately $ 1B! üëÄ

Folks think Laszlo blew it spending that much on pizza, while others reckon he‚Äôs a legend for believing in Bitcoin when it was just this weird new thing.

Laszlo‚Äôs pizza buy was the first time anyone used Bitcoin to snag something real-world. It put Bitcoin on the map, got people talking, and probably helped kick off its rise to what it is now.

https://preview.redd.it/kibvvjgm2cxe1.jpg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fcf790162d1e0ffe1e06723b926276e88dbdb6a

Every year, the crypto crowd throws a little party for Bitcoin Pizza Day to give a nod to this moment and the early believers who took a chance on it.

My curiosity is how much did he own then? How much did it cost him to own that? How much did he HODL after buying pizza? And how much more did he sell?

Anyways... what‚Äôs your take guys ?

Was Laszlo a genius who helped make Bitcoin legit, or just a guy craving a slice?  
Should we toast him for his part in crypto history?"

It‚Äôs more about stability and long-term growth. But when it comes to venture capital in crypto, it‚Äôs a different ballgame.

Most crypto startups are still in their early stages‚Äîmany don‚Äôt even have a product yet‚Äîso the approach has to be more forward-looking and based on potential rather than past performance.

What I usually look at first is the team behind the project. Are they experienced? Do they have a history of delivering results? In crypto, a strong team really makes a difference.

Then there‚Äôs the problem the project is solving‚Äîis it a real-world issue, or just another copy of something that already exists? The tokenomics are also critical. If the token doesn‚Äôt have a clear use or if the distribution is unbalanced, that‚Äôs usually a red flag for me.

Another huge factor is the community. A project with a strong, engaged community has a much better chance of surviving and growing. I‚Äôve seen projects with great tech fail just because no one was using or supporting them. And of course, execution matters. A solid roadmap is great, but can they actually deliver on what they promised?

***For a crypto startup to succeed today, it needs more than just hype.***¬†It has to provide real utility, stay transparent, and be ready to adapt because the space evolves so fast. Partnerships, integrations, and even how well the team communicates with the public all matter a lot now.***For investors, especially today, it‚Äôs important not to get blinded by hype.***¬†You really have to dig deep‚Äîunderstand the project‚Äôs fundamentals, the market it‚Äôs entering, the team‚Äôs vision, and whether the token actually has a purpose.¬†***Crypto VC is high risk, but with the right approach, it can also bring high rewards.***

Why do most cryptocurrency reward events primarily target existing users?,0,1k9va8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k9va8h/why_do_most_cryptocurrency_reward_events/,9,2025-04-28 08:15:56,"Many projects in the crypto space like seeing new users get involved in their activities. But once these users join, the project teams often tend to forget about them, without even welcoming them further with new, bigger events designed for advanced newcomers to engage.  
  
This has been frustrating many newbies, especially those in my community. I think we should start putting more pressure on project teams that have the habit of forgetting about their new members right after onboarding them, while redirecting all their focus back to old-timers. What do you think?"

In my eyes they reduce a layer of complexity by eliminating a whole subset of smart contracts that exist to represent and distribute an asset on a chain that does have smart contracts, but does not have native assets.  

Can someone more familiar please enlighten me with their thoughts? Are the smart contracts involved in issuing an asset on a chain without native assets really not that complicated and can be easily audited or something?  

Without naming specific blockchains, are native assets not a hugely important development? On my chain of choice I can see if an asset has clawback, how many were minted, distributed, etc. And the assets have the same security properties of the blockchain‚Äôs native token.

I‚Äôm about to make a quick USDC transfer, but I‚Äôm running into some confusion. The receiving wallet specifies BEP-20 as the required network, while my exchange only offers BNB Smart Chain (BSC) as the option. After a bit of Googling and checking with ChatGPT, it seems that BEP-20 is simply the token standard used on BSC, so they‚Äôre technically the same. That said, I just want to double-check with the community before going ahead. Is it totally safe to send USDC via BNB Smart Chain to a wallet that specifies BEP-20? Any clarification would be much appreciated. Thanks! No DMs, please.

**UPDATE-** I specifically said no DMs, but I have received several DMs saying they are the same but I need to ""validate"" the wallet first. LMFAO!!! The crypto community never fails to disappoint!"
