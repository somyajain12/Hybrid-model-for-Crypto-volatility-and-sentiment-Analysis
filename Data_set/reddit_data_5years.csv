Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,47,1jwz2d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jwz2d3/bitcoin_newcomers_faq_please_read/,10,2025-04-11 14:59:15,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

In this SPAR supermarket in 🇨🇭 Switzerland you can pay for everything with Bitcoin Lightning 😃,204,1k9ak5c,https://v.redd.it/9awfpgln5fxe1,17,2025-04-27 13:16:28,

There are only about 900,000 Bitcoin wallets that hold 1 BTC or more - and due to lost keys, forgotten wallets, and long-term holders, the real number of living, reachable ""whole coiners"" is likely closer to 500,000.

As Bitcoin's adoption grows and supply remains capped at 21 million, owning 1 full Bitcoin will soon be seen as an extraordinary achievement, not just a financial asset.

Think about it:

🟠 If every millionaire today wanted to own just one Bitcoin, it would be mathematically impossible.

🟠 Demand will rise. Supply will not.

🟠 The number of whole coiners will continue to fall as Bitcoin is divided, spent, or lost.

At some point, owning just 0.1 BTC will be considered elite. At some point, people will look back and say, ""I had the chance to own a whole Bitcoin… but I let it slip.""

The opportunity is still here. But for how long?"

.28 BTC = Top 1 percent Hodler,14,1k9e8t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k9e8t7/28_btc_top_1_percent_hodler/,3,2025-04-27 15:54:54,"Grok answers - Estimated Approx Effective Supply is 16.8 million BTC

Determining the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) needed to be in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of holders “forever” is complex due to Bitcoin’s uneven distribution, lost coins, and varying holder numbers over time. The estimates below are based on current data (as of April 2025) and assumptions about Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million BTC, with adjustments for lost coins and concentration of ownership. These figures are approximations, as precise holder numbers and future distribution patterns are uncertain. All calculations assume the current global population of approximately 8 billion and account for factors like lost coins and whale accumulation.

Key Assumptions

•  Total Bitcoin Supply: 21 million BTC, with ~19.8 million currently in circulation.

•  Lost Coins: Estimates suggest 20–29% of Bitcoin is lost forever (e.g., inaccessible wallets, Satoshi’s unspent coins). A conservative 20% loss (4.2 million BTC) reduces the effective supply to ~16.8 million BTC.

•  Uneven Distribution: Bitcoin is highly concentrated, with ~1.86% of addresses holding over 90% of BTC, and the top 10,000 investors (0.01% of holders) owning ~27% of the supply.

•  Holder Population: The number of Bitcoin holders is estimated to be between 50–200 million globally, far less than the world population, but for “forever” estimates, we assume mass adoption scenarios where up to 1 billion people might hold Bitcoin.

•  “Forever” Context: To be in the top percentiles indefinitely, you need to hold more than the average under a mass adoption scenario, accounting for whale accumulation and lost coins reducing available supply.

Methodology

The estimates are derived by:

1.  Calculating the effective circulating supply (21M - 20% lost = 16.8M BTC).

2.  Estimating the BTC needed to be in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of holders under a simplified model where 1 billion people adopt Bitcoin, then adjusting for real-world concentration based on current blockchain data and whale behavior.

3.  Using posts on X and web analyses for additional context, acknowledging their speculative nature.

Estimates for Top 1%, 5%, and 10% of Bitcoin Holders

Top 1% (Top 1% of 1B = 10M holders)

•  Theoretical Calculation: If 16.8M BTC were evenly distributed among 1 billion people, each would hold 0.0168 BTC. To be in the top 1% (10M holders), you’d need more than the 99th percentile holder. Assuming a power-law distribution (as Bitcoin wealth follows), the top 1% likely hold significantly more than the average.

•  Adjusted Estimate: Current analyses suggest 0.28 BTC guarantees top 1% status in today’s market due to concentration and lost coins. For “forever” with mass adoption, whale accumulation (e.g., top 10,000 holders owning 27%) suggests you’d need ~0.21–0.26 BTC to stay ahead of 99% of holders, as fewer coins will be available to the masses.

•  Final Estimate: ~0.25 BTC to be in the top 1% forever, assuming 20% lost coins and high concentration.
Top 5% (Top 5% of 1B = 50M holders)

•  Theoretical Calculation: To be in the top 5% (50M holders), you’d need more than the 95th percentile holder. With 16.8M BTC, the average holding per person (1B) is 0.0168 BTC, but the top 5% would hold disproportionately more due to wealth skew.

•  Adjusted Estimate: Posts on X suggest 0.2 BTC for the top 5% in current conditions, but with mass adoption, the threshold decreases due to wider distribution. Accounting for whales and lost coins, ~0.1–0.2 BTC is likely sufficient to outrank 95% of holders.

•  Final Estimate: ~0.15 BTC to be in the top 5% forever, reflecting moderate concentration.

Top 10% (Top 10% of 1B = 100M holders)

•  Theoretical Calculation: To be in the top 10% (100M holders), you’d need more than the 90th percentile holder. The average holding (16.8M ÷ 1B) is 0.0168 BTC, but the top 10% would hold more due to uneven distribution.

•  Adjusted Estimate: X posts estimate 0.026–0.1 BTC for the top 10% today, reduced by lost coins and whale holdings. For mass adoption, ~0.05 BTC should suffice, as the bottom 90% will hold minimal amounts (e.g., microtransactions or fractional sats).

•  Final Estimate: ~0.05 BTC to be in the top 10% forever, given high whale control and limited supply.

Caveats

•  Dynamic Distribution: Bitcoin’s distribution may become more or less concentrated over time. If whales consolidate further, thresholds could rise; if adoption spreads, they could fall.
•  Lost Coins Uncertainty: If more than 20% of BTC is lost, thresholds decrease further (e.g., 29% lost reduces supply to ~15M BTC).

•  Holder Numbers: The assumption of 1 billion holders is speculative. If fewer people adopt Bitcoin, less BTC is needed to rank in the top percentiles.

•  Data Limitations: Blockchain data doesn’t reveal individual owners (one person can control multiple addresses), and exchange-held BTC skews perceptions of retail ownership.

•  Market Volatility: These estimates focus on BTC amounts, not USD value, which fluctuates (e.g., 0.25 BTC ≈ $23,500 at $94,000/BTC as of April 2025).

Conclusion - 

To be in the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of Bitcoin holders “forever,” you’d likely need ~0.25 BTC, ~0.15 BTC, and ~0.05 BTC, respectively, based on a 16.8M BTC effective supply and mass adoption by 1 billion people. These figures are lower than current estimates (e.g., 0.28 BTC for top 1%) due to lost coins and whale concentration reducing available BTC for the masses."

Bitcoin: The Future of Money?  
  
I handed out pizza and 1 BTC to everyone who showed up.  
  
I had been telling everyone I knew about Bitcoin, helping them install the client, download the blockchain, and send their first transaction.  
  
Then I read a post from a guy who had just graduated MIT. He was planning a road trip across the U.S. only spending Bitcoin. The catch? He needed people to meet him at gas stations and trade gas for BTC, since clerks wouldn't take it.  
  
I told him: ""If you pass through Huntsville, I can meet you and maybe even get you a speaking gig.""  
  
I went to the head of Computer Science at my university and pitched it: this new decentralized currency, the MIT grad on a road trip, the big ideas. He gave me the green light and a lecture hall.  
  
On the day of the talk, I got a few friends to hand out flyers I printed. I tried to hit every building with a tailored message: taxes and monetary policy in the business school, code and crypto in the engineering halls. One guy crumpled the flyer in my face. Others just nodded and walked on.  
  
A few hours before the event, we met Plato, that was the MIT guy's alias. He was skateboarding in the parking lot, wearing a bandana. Totally on brand.  
  
About 20 people showed up, mostly students, a couple faculty. Like I said, I brought free pizza (best way to get college kids to show up). And I gave 1 BTC to everyone who came.  
  
We talked about building an entirely new financial system. Open, borderless, unstoppable. We said there was massive growth ahead. New markets. New ways of thinking about value.  
  
I recorded the whole thing and put it on YouTube. At the end, during Q&A, a professor stood up and said:

Im not familiar with Strike but I see it's mentioned here frequently so I'd like to hear *why it's the choice for some.

I'd like to here the same for River, Kracken, etc.

I use River because its BTC only. When there's a very high volume of transactions taking place River doesn't go ""temporarily offline"" like awful Coinbase. River also lets you transfer to Cold wallet, or pull cash previously deposited back out after 7 days. Said cash also earns 0.038% interest in *BTC so it's similar to a high yield savings account. I DCA is USD and then buy the dip when its more beneficial. Meanwhile my USD still actively earns 0.038% BTC.

Why not just DCA directly into BTC? Because I've already invested a set amount I'm comfortable with and I like keeping a certain amount liquid for emergency situations. I use River as an interim investment/savings account. If there's a significant dip i have the funds to buy already set aside and I don't touch my primary fiat savings. If the great depression hits it acts as another security layer of liquidity without having to sell my BTC for emergencies."

Then, I feel that my time horizon is too short. Given the BTC's volatility and common recommendations of this subreddit, anything below \~10 years of hodling is a pure gamble.

Finally, BTC can tank to (near) zero and never recover.

I've tested the scripts against just raw directories of tens of thousands of files, .doc, .jpg, .zip, etc and they don't yield any hashable data, even raw addresses or just PKs that fit the format, zero.  So what I'm finding in binary is legitimately real and some are on the blockchain.  And yes, accounting for the easy/fake LLLLL... PKs and Trojan Ware traces, there's still ones that don't fit those definitions. 

The mystery to me is why this data is on these drives?  What's a wallet address doing on a hard drive?  What's that private key doing there as well?

The more we talked, the more it felt like a race to create a new reserve currency — one that could replace the U.S. dollar.

As someone who’s fully immersed in crypto, it’s hard not to wonder:
Are we still on the path of decentralization and freedom, or have we veered into something darker?

It feels like the original spirit of crypto is being twisted into a tool for control, not empowerment.

What do you think? Is the dream still alive — or are we losing it?

Don't worry about buying at the top. You're buying at future lows.,258,1k84s1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k84s1e/dont_worry_about_buying_at_the_top_youre_buying/,33,2025-04-25 23:38:51,"Confirmed I'm a late entrant to BTC, but I am doing my best to rapidly stack sats. With the dollar falling and stocks being unpredictable, what starts to be more obvious is that Bitcoin is something of a ""safe"" haven, made even more solid by the capped number of BTC that can ever be produced. There will be more demand and there will be no more supply, which will continue to push price pressures upward.

So if you're looking at Bitcoin at 95k or 85k or 105k and thinking you don't want to get in at the top, not only is dollar cost averaging the best way to stop chasing a pricepoint, but it is time to start thinking of the current prices not as all time highs, but instead as future lows that may never be available again.

Every one-time all time high has been left in the dust and may not ever be seen again. This means the best time to buy is always until the next time and then you buy again. BTC is cheap at 95k and it will be cheap at 120k and will be cheap at 250k. That's the game. "
Did Satoshi choose 21M as a nod to the inflation of ‘truth’ itself?,183,1k868gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k868gc/did_satoshi_choose_21m_as_a_nod_to_the_inflation/,111,2025-04-26 01:12:03,"Most people explain Bitcoin's 21 million supply limit by referencing mining rewards and halvings (50 → 25 → 12.5 → etc.).
But if you think critically, you'll notice:

Satoshi could have set block halvings after 200,000 or 250,000 blocks instead of 210,000.

He could have chosen a starting reward of 40, 60, or any other value.

The total supply could have been any number — 20 million, 25 million, 50 million — depending on simple design choices.

Now, recently I watched a 2007 lecture by Kent Hovind called **""Dinosaurs and the Bible""**.

Originally, I was simply curious about the topic of dinosaurs in the Bible (not Bitcoin, not earth age theories).
But then something jumped out at me:

Starting around **minute 45:00** Kent Hovind explains how, throughout modern history, scientists have kept **increasing** the estimated age of the Earth:

- In 1770, the Earth was said to be 70,000 years old.

- In 1905, it became 2 billion years old.

- In 1969, it was raised to 3.5 billion years old.

- Today, it's 4.6 billion years old.

He jokingly calculates that, based on the historical record, **the Earth's age ""inflates"" by about 21 million years per year.**

Now — Bitcoin’s whitepaper was published **in 2008**, just after this lecture was circulating online.

**Here’s the theory:**

Satoshi might have seen the irony that not just currencies inflate — but even supposed scientific ""truth"" about fundamental things like the age of the Earth inflates over time.
Choosing **21 million** bitcoins could be a subtle philosophical jab:

- A fixed, hard limit against **monetary inflation**,

- And perhaps symbolically, a fixed limit against the **inflation of truth itself**.

In a world where everything — money, facts, narratives — keeps inflating and losing meaning, Bitcoin stands as a rare creation with **hard, unchangeable scarcity.**

**Important note:**

- I realize there’s no direct proof.

- But when you look at Satoshi’s style (hidden references, anti-inflation ethos, philosophical undertones) — and the timing (2007 lecture, 2008 whitepaper) — it makes this theory very logically possible.

Maybe Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap isn’t just about economics...
Maybe it's also a message about truth, scarcity, and resistance to human tendency to endlessly inflate everything.

**Would love to hear what you all think. Has anyone else ever made this connection before?**"

Nothing crazy, just a slow and steady strategy I plan to hold long-term. I also read Thank God for Bitcoin, and honestly, it really clicked for me — I’ve been hooked ever since and kind of wish I’d gotten into it sooner.

Anyway, I was chatting with a close friend who works in finance, and he basically told me I was stupid for investing in BTC. He said it’s “too volatile” and that I don’t know what I’m doing. Even when I tried to show him the year-over-year returns and explain that I’m not gambling — just adopting a long-term HODL mindset — he brushed it off like I was wasting my money.

It kind of got to me. I know Bitcoin isn’t for everyone, and maybe one day he’ll regret not getting in earlier, but I really thought I was taking a pretty reasonable approach.

How do you handle it when people dismiss your financial decisions — especially when you’ve actually put time and thought into them? Am I missing something here, or is this just a “different strokes for different folks” situation?

However, I believe we all have a responsibility — if you truly believe in the movement — to protect it. Crypto is more than just a financial revolution; to me, it’s a way of life. It’s interconnected in ways that go far beyond the internet we know today.

We now have the chance to connect and create opportunities like never before, but just like the internet when it first emerged, crypto also carries its own set of dangers. I’ve been in this space for years, and I’ve watched it evolve dramatically. My concern is that people may lose sight of the original core values that sparked the movement in the first place.

I believe the solution lies in more innovation and creativity from the people, integrating crypto into our daily lives. People don’t care how things work behind the scenes, they just want to know: Does it serve them?

You don’t need to be a tech genius or business mogul to make a difference. We interact with tech like crypto daily, and its potential to improve our lives is huge. Imagine a world where you choose where your data resides and is encrypted, secure, and free from bad actors. No more data brokers selling our info, allowing people to engage freely without fear.

Small businesses using this technology can build stronger, more direct connections with their communities, fostering trust and real relationships.

We also need to consider education. Teachers can use this tech to teach students not just facts, but how to solve problems in multiple ways — giving them a toolkit for life and a broader perspective on the world.

Most importantly, we need to realize that freedom goes beyond what we’ve been told. It’s time to open our eyes.

I researched a lot, but it doesn't seem to be unavailable in Georgia. And there's no info on how long it takes to process that activation.

If anyone ever faced this problem, kindly let me know. Appreciate your help!"

Bitcoin is the “Ultimate Arrow Security” which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory.,25,1k83u9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k83u9x/bitcoin_is_the_ultimate_arrow_security_which/,6,2025-04-25 22:43:50,"Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin’s payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin’s price itself also signals the market’s assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it’s status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

This argument rests on Nobel Prize level economic theory that is now widely accepted among central banks and corporate financiers.

Happy Bitcoining. We’ve done it. We have brought sanity and discipline to a multipolar world order.

Redefinition of the Unit:
Internally, the smallest indivisible unit remains unchanged.
Historically, 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 base units. Under this proposal, ""1 bitcoin"" equals that smallest unit.
What was previously referred to as ""1 bitcoin"" now corresponds to 100 million bitcoins under the new definition.

So if you currently only what is referred to as 0.1 Bitcoin, if BIP 177 passes you will hold 10 million Bitcoins."

I am currently searching a second broker to invest in BTC in a DCA way (in opposition to trading)—I do that for the purpose of 'broker diversification' let's say. So, I have a couple of 'easy' questions about Binance which is a candidate for me.

1. Does it cost anything to fund your account with fiat currency—specifically CZK? Via bank transfer, debit/credit cards, etc.
2. What are the typical transactional costs? For buying BTC and selling it?
3. What are the typical costs for withdrawing fiat?
4. What are the typical costs for withdrawing BTC (onto a wallet)?

I hope my questions make sense. Feel free to ask for clarifications in case it's needed.

In 2021, the total crypto market cap peaked at $3 trillion. Fast forward to 2025, and we’ve already hit a new all-time high of $3.73 trillion. That sounds huge, until you realize the U.S. alone prints that much in a single year.

Let that sink in: the entire crypto market, at its absolute peak, is roughly equal to one year of USD creation. Fiat is being inflated at a staggering rate, and yet people still think buying Bitcoin on credit is ""too risky""?

Since the First Industrial Revolution, global GDP has exploded, from a few hundred billion in the 1800s to over $105 trillion in 2024. This growth, driven by fossil fuels, tech, and industry, is now hitting hard limits. The Earth is finite. The current system demands 3% growth forever, but physics, ecosystems, and energy flows don’t play that game.

[Assuming a steady 3&#37; annual growth rate, the global economy would double roughly every 24 years. That means by 2048, global GDP could reach around $218 trillion.](https://preview.redd.it/imzppr36a2xe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ec1e3de39589f2749bcb307774d9a78292e3ec)

What does this mean? Fiat currencies are already credit-based, backed by debt, endless printing, and faith in perpetual expansion. It’s a system built on borrowed time.

So here’s the controversial take: if you're going to live in a world built on debt, why not use that to your advantage? Buying Bitcoin on credit isn’t just speculation, it’s a hedge against the slow implosion of a debt-based fiat system.

No, this doesn’t mean max out your credit cards recklessly. But intelligently using leverage to exit a doomed system might not be as crazy as it sounds. Especially when the alternative is watching your savings silently melt under inflation.

Is it risky? Sure. But so is staying in fiat."

Inflation is very simply the growth of the money supply, commonly referred to as M2.  

You will never hear that on  Bloomberg, CNBC, FoxBiz, etc as it does not fit the narrative of the advertiser paymasters.  

The chart below I pulled off of St. Louis Fed website and simply had AI calculate the rates for the time period 1980-2025.  Bottom line your investments need to yield 6.7% POST TAX to tread water.  Less than that you are falling behind.  $100K today needs to be $138K by 2030 just to buy the same loaf of bread. 

Do you keep all your money in T-Bills?  HELL NO.  Do you keep it in cash?  HELL NO.  Would you put is all in XYZ Corp Stock?  HELL NO.  Would you put it all in Bitcoin? HELL NO. I might but I am nuts...

So what do you do?  How do you boost your yield but keep your investment safe at the same time?  

There is an answer: add a little bit of Bitcoin.  

By simply adding X% of Bitcoin to your favorite investment you drastically increase your Sharpe Ratio (risk adjusted return). I am not here to tell you how much BTC to add but you need some. Do some homework on it.  Ask you financial advisor.  Literally one digit of Bitcoin can make the difference between BEATING INFLATION or being BEAT BY INFLATION. "

I’ve dabbled in crypto for a while, but I never actually went through the process of holding BTC in a wallet I fully control.

I started looking into options and came across [bitcoin.org’s wallet chooser](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). It asks a few questions and recommends wallets based on your answers, which sounds helpful... but I’m wondering how legit it is or if it’s outdated or missing better options.

Have any of you actually used that to pick a wallet? Or do most of you just already know which one to use?

For context, I’m mostly looking for a beginner-friendly wallet for holding small to medium amounts of BTC, ideally something that balances security and ease of use. I’ve heard of things like BlueWallet, Sparrow, and Electrum, but I don’t know how they compare. I’m not ready for a full cold storage setup yet, just want to get off exchanges and start managing my own keys properly.

Also, how paranoid should I be about fake wallet apps? Like if I download something from the App Store or a website, how do I double-check it’s real? I don’t want to screw up on step one.

Credit system on a Bitcoin standard,11,1k7ekq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k7ekq1/credit_system_on_a_bitcoin_standard/,19,2025-04-25 01:52:11,"I often find myself wondering about credit systems on a Bitcoin, true sound money standard. 

The below is a bit of a brain dump with the hope of understanding the thoughts of others on this topic.

Now to be clear, this is not something that concerns me personally, because I personally wouldn’t feel the need to take credit for something that I can actually save up for, knowing the purchasing power of my savings is going to be preserved, probably even rise!

And I would hope that most people would feel this way too, once they realise their purchasing power isn’t being stolen from them. However, I’m not naive to the reality that the world is addicted to credit, and there will be demand for it, at least initially. So, how do you all feel about this?

My concern for the masses is that, on a sound money system, taking credit recklessly is going to get you burned. Unless the credit you’re taking is going to productive use, to generate greater future returns, it will wipe you out, because you’re going to have to pay back more in real value. 

Granted, there should be less need to take credit across the board, even for homes, because as they stop being used as a store of value out of necessity, they fall back to their true utility value, and you can just save up for one. If they’re still to overpriced, lower demand will force prices down further.

But the reality is there will be demand for it, at least initially, and financial institutions will still be desperate to hold onto that business. The way I look at it right now is, it’ll be an adjustment, and unfortunately a lot of people will learn the hard way that taking credit without due consideration, or without the intention of putting it to productive use, will cause them harm. And really that’s how it should be, if your taking credit it should be because the anticipated productivity increases are expected to provide monetary benefits that would allow you to pay off the credit + provide an ongoing increase in income.

I guess like all things, people will do what they do, get burned, and learn over time"

"how in theory would ""paper bitcoin"" enter the ETF space?",0,1k7ln7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k7ln7l/how_in_theory_would_paper_bitcoin_enter_the_etf/,13,2025-04-25 08:59:48,"This is not an endorsement of the ETF's, before you auto-rage-respond ""Just buy real bitcoin"", read my full question.  (I do actual cold storage the majority of my holdings)

I listen to a lot of bitcoin podcasts, some more well put together than others.  And a small talking point I have heard a few times is the possibility of deceit/fraud/etc, in the form of ""paper bitcoin"" when investing in the ETF's.  However none of those podcast hosts actually take the time to explain how a nefarious actor could in practice do something deceitful like this.  I don't know if these hosts are just fear mongering, throwing out buzzwords, are extremely uneducated....or if I am?  However unlike these hosts, I am always willing to hear another's point of view and consider the possibility that I am incorrect or uneducated about a particular topic.

  
In my knowledge of the traditional finance system, the redemption creation process for an ETF issuer is a highly regulated and standardized and auditable process.  (Bitcoiners love to hate on the SEC but they have done some things that protect the customer).  Furthermore, given that the ETFs are so new, and it was a very contentious process to get them approved, it is reasonable to believe that they are going to be subject to a higher level of scrutiny.  

  
With that being said.  Is the possibility of a bitcoin ETF investor getting screwed a real threat due to so called ""paper bitcoin""?  And how would that mechanics of that work?  Because in my mind (correct me if I am wrong) the very oversimplified process would play out like the following:

1. Consumer buys more bitcoin ETF

2. ETF issuer ""I need to purchase more actual bitcoin as part of the regulated creation process with my exchange partner""

3. Exchange partner ""ah shit, liquidity is drying up, we don't have it, here is an IOU, don't tell anyone, I promise we will square up with you tomorrow""

4.?????

  
It seems like the ability to introduce fraud into the system starts at step 3, however it would be caught relatively quickly.  In which case some regulatory body steps in and says ""you are short, makes your books straight ASAP or we are going to fine you"".  In which case ETF issuer and exchange partner say OK, we are purchasing the required amount at market rate asap and Boom...price goes up.  

  
Can someone comment on my questions and whether there is a legitimate concern of so called paper-bitcoin by investing in the ETFs?"

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

•	⁠April 2026 (t = 13.25): 51.5 oz/BTC

•	⁠April 2027 (t = 14.25): 95.2 oz/BTC

•	⁠April 2028 (t = 15.25): 176.1 oz/BTC

--- CRITICAL CAVEATS ---
 * Illustrative Average Trend ONLY: Ignores real volatility/cycles. Actual chart differs drastically.
 * No Predictive Value.
 * NOT Financial Advice.

This model isolates the severely smoothed trend; actual market behavior is dominated by volatility around this average.

Ledger Nano to ColdCard?,0,1k7lhy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k7lhy5/ledger_nano_to_coldcard/,16,2025-04-25 08:53:16,"Hi All,  

Looking for advice as I’m not very tech savvy.

I bought a couple Bitcoin about 10 years ago, heard not your keys not your coins, especially with the MT GOX thing, so at that time bought a ledger nano s to store them on as that was the “best” for us non-technical folks. Moved them to that and haven’t touched it since. 

Kinda been outta the space since then, but now that it’s been a while and that small investment has grown substantially I want to move those couple coins to something more secure, especially with all I’ve heard about ledger. So I’d like to store them for at least another 10-15 years or more. That said, I bought the ColdCard Q.

Here is what I’d like to achieve. I want to move my Bitcoin from the ledger to the ColdCard in the safest way possible. I’ve gotten conflicting info everywhere. Some say use sparrow, others say ledger live but then others say don’t use ledger live. I’m not smart enough to figure all that out and it’s a significant amount of money, and I don’t want to do something stupid.

How would you guys go about moving the coins from the ledger nano s which I’m guessing may need an update, but I’d prefer not to do that if possible. I have my access pin and my seed phrase, but do not want to put the seed phrase in anywhere as I know that’s a big no-no.

Just looking for some help/advice. I don’t mind watching YouTube videos to walk me through the process, but just want to make sure my retirement or my kids inheritance is safe and secure. 

Thanks in advance!

Swann uses this reading to explore common misunderstandings about Bitcoin and to provide counterarguments.​

**NOT LOOKING FOR INVESTMENT ADVICE**  
Repost from yesterday since it got removed, not looking for advice just starting conversations.

I’m a student, and plan on taking out the max state-backed student loan:  
→ €850/month × 29 months = **24650€**

Also if I graduate on time, in my country the government forgives 3320€, of my loan so I will be left to repay around **21330€**.

  
Interest is Euribor 6 month+ 0,5% bank margin, and repayment starts 2 years after graduation. Interest will not be paid for the 3 years while studying. Loan period is 10 years. 

I’m planning to invest **100% of it into Bitcoin** and hold long-term.  
I see it as low-interest leverage + time on my side. I get the student  loan paid to me annually so 3x **8216€.** I haven't yet decided if I should lump buy or dca.



Would love to hear opinions and answer questions."

Borrow fiat to buy BTC,27,1k6ilia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k6ilia/borrow_fiat_to_buy_btc/,34,2025-04-23 22:32:24,"As seen on Xitter: https://x.com/bitmundfreud/status/1915119898499448983 

“What if you could turn the banks’ own game against them, borrow their fiat to buy Bitcoin?

It’s a bold move, and when I asked X, “Is it wise to borrow money to invest in Bitcoin?” almost 350 replies poured in, each a lesson in navigating this high-stakes choice.

I’d just checked my bank’s site and was stunned: a £35,000 personal loan, offered in minutes with a few clicks, no deep questions about my goals - including holiday or home renovations. It got me thinking, could this debt stack sats instead? 

The people shared diverse takes. Real moves:

Alex - $30k on 0% credit cards, 18 months. Bitcoin’s up 40%. Debt paid off early.

Ron - $100k loan, $1,113/month. $85k cost basis now worth $93k+.

Chris -  sed a 0.99% balance transfer, 16 months at 3% flat, with vehicle equity as a safety net.

Pros? Low-rate debt (0–10%) lets you buy Bitcoin, historically up much more annually since 2010. 

Cons? Volatility, like the recent $74,000 dip, risks forced sales if payments strain you. 

Over-leveraging or swing trading can wipe you out, and some argue debt clashes with Bitcoin’s ethos, favouring DCA instead. 

My take: It’s situational. 
Low rates, financial stability (no high-interest debt, emergency fund), and a 5–10-year horizon make it viable, but only if you can HODL through dips. That £35,000 loan tempts me to stack sats, but probably I'll start with £2,000-£5,000.  Otherwise, I’ll DCA and sleep easy.

Weigh your risks, and choose your path.”

He just hasn’t realized it yet.

He sees the same problems Bitcoiners do:

* Wealth inequality as a feature, not a bug
* A debt-based system that needs infinite liquidity
* Asset inflation benefiting the rich
* Fiat money as the root cause of structural dysfunction

But he still clings to redistribution and wealth taxes without questioning the system that made the inequality inevitable in the first place.

So I laid out the full case for why Bitcoin actually fixes the problems he cares about and why he’ll flip eventually (as they all will)."

MicroStrategy Stock Analysis and Misinformation,62,1k62nd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k62nd4/microstrategy_stock_analysis_and_misinformation/,9,2025-04-23 10:53:45,"I've seen that most people don’t actually understand how MicroStrategy works in a lot of these subs.

There are a lot of posts that treat MicroStrategy like it’s just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin or a “Bitcoin ETF with upside.” That’s not really what’s actually going on when you buy MSTR.

It’s clear that most people (even bulls) don’t fully get the engine behind this company.

We asked a CFA charter holder to help us walk through it off the books, just to make sure we weren’t missing anything. Their perspective helped clarify a lot.

Since 2020, Strategy (that’s the new name they go by) has been raising capital through common stock, preferred stock, and convertible debt. Not to grow revenue or expand operations but to buy more BTC.

The company is basically converting market optimism and volatility into more Bitcoin on the balance sheet. When investor appetite is strong and the stock is running, they raise. When BTC dips or the market cools, they hold.

It’s a financial structure designed to accumulate assets over time.

They mostly issue convertible debt. These are bonds that can turn into stock if the price goes high enough.

Because of something called convexity, this structure benefits from volatility. When the stock goes up, the bond gains value faster. When it drops, the bond doesn’t fall as hard.

Some institutions take advantage of this by doing delta-neutral trades. They buy the bond and short the stock, so they don’t care where the price goes. They just want movement.

MicroStrategy’s system actually works better when the stock is volatile.

They created an internal metric called BTC Yield. It tracks how much Bitcoin they’re adding compared to how much dilution they’re causing. If BTC Yield is positive, it means they’re accumulating more BTC per share, even while issuing more stock or debt.

And this is the part I think a lot of people miss. You’re not buying “leveraged Bitcoin” when you buy MSTR. You’re buying the *possibility* of future leverage. That only works if they can keep raising money and if BTC keeps rising. If either of those breaks, the premium disappears.

Without volatility, and more directly, new capital, the premium for future leverage will collapse. The question is: *will it happen when Bitcoin is worth $2 trillion, or $200 trillion?*

Strategy is not a pure Bitcoin bet. It’s a bet on volatility and emotion.

This is not about belief in Bitcoin alone. It’s about understanding the vehicle you’re using to gain exposure.

In fact, for many investors, the cleaner and more cost-effective move may be to **simply buy Bitcoin directly**.

We partnered to write a full breakdown of how the model works, not just the Bitcoin angle but the capital structure too. We're not long the stock. Just think people should understand what they’re actually buying.

Hello, I am in need of people who have technical skills relating to Xcode and App development for a new StartUp I am launching for a Crypto Banking platform. If any of you have been watching, the FDIC has opened the doorway for cryptocurrency usage in traditional banking (March 25, 2025). This is a service that everyone is now racing too, Coinbase and nearly every other cryptocurrency platform/ exchange is working to get their banking license. Luckily that takes at least a year usually. This App is about 50% of the way to being completed in terms to how i want it to look I just need technical help to finish it (i.e. finishing coding and smoothing out the rough edge’s.) 

I have family friends who can provide the bank license partnership and have already found a stock brokerage for sale that is quite affordable. I’m waiting for the EIN which I’ll be able to get on Friday or next Monday and then i will put this on a crowdfunding App as well as start marketing it. 

I am looking for people who are very familiar with computer coding particularly Xcode and are taking computer science/ computer engineering degree (preferably computer engineering). I already have a storyboard of how i generally want the app to function (based on what I’ve learned) nevertheless i need some additional help. I am in the process of finding API software, or i might have to make it. 

I am looking for 5-7 people who can commit to this project (aside from regular schoolwork) for about two weeks. 

If anyone is interested reach out we can do a zoom meeting or meet irl. 

Edit: the only reason I’m reaching out for extra help is because of how quickly this is moving and i want to ensure that we are first to the finish line. FYI, there is no service that provides banking to the crypto industry (Bitcoin alone is a 1trillion dollar industry)"

Bitcoin's Parabolic Moves = Adoption Accelerating in Real-Time (Network Effect Snowball),0,1k6t83c,https://i.redd.it/fa393zv9jswe1.jpeg,18,2025-04-24 09:11:43," Network Effect: Bitcoin gets stronger & more valuable as more people use, mine, and build on it (more utility, security, liquidity). This growth attracts even more people (like a snowball rolling downhill).

 Adoption Accelerates: Sometimes, the speed at which people join goes exponential. When adoption accelerates rapidly, demand vastly outstrips Bitcoin's fixed supply, forcing prices up sharply.

TL;DR: Those crazy parabolic price surges often aren't random – they're a signal that the Bitcoin network effect is kicking into high gear, reflecting adoption happening faster and faster. The price chart is visualizing the snowball gaining speed.

On the website [https://www.satoshipixelgrid.com/](https://www.satoshipixelgrid.com/), there is a drawing canvas with dimensions of 10,000 x 10,000. That means the usable area contains 100,000,000 pixels. One pixel represents 1 Satoshi. Thanks to LN, you can instantly buy even a single pixel—which wouldn’t have been possible just a few years ago.

You can use the canvas to create various shapes, artworks, logos, texts—anything you like. Once you buy pixels like this, they remain on the site permanently, and no one can take them away from you.

AI (specifically Claude 3.7 Sonnet) helped me a lot with creating this project. I’d be happy if someone tries it out and gives me some feedback :) Thanks!"

Is there any foreign exchange risk involved if I buy iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (denominated in USD FIAT) with Euro FIAT and after years of holding sell it for Euro FIAT?,0,1k65mb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k65mb0/is_there_any_foreign_exchange_risk_involved_if_i/,16,2025-04-23 12:52:23,"hi guys,

i'm resident of European Union and I would like to DCA buy and long-term HODL the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). I have cash in EURO FIAT and I would be buying IBIT ETF, which is denominated in USD FIAT. After years of holding, I would be then selling IBIT back to EURO FIAT.

So the whole buying and selling procedure looks something like this: EURO FIAT -> conversion to USD FIAT -> buy IBIT ETF -> hold for years -> sell IBIT ETF for USD FIAT -> conversion to EUR FIAT.

My question is, am I exposed to any foreign exchange risk? Or in other words, can foreign exchange fluctuations diminish my possible returns of IBIT ETF?

EXAMPLE:

Say that I buy IBIT ETF at some price. In few years, I make 20% of return and then I sell the ETF, get USD FIAT out of it and immediately convert it to EURO FIAT. In the same period, USD FIAT loses against EURO FIAT for 20%. So in such case, at the end, I would have 0 return?

I made around $80K off a $7K investment which helped with the down payment on our first house. Should feel great, right? Not exactly. Every time BTC pumps I tell my wife about what could have been. In her words, “Bitcoin is the worst thing that’s happened to our relationship.” 

So I dug into this feeling and here's where I landed: Bitcoin regret isn’t just common, it’s *inevitable*. Bitcoin is a currency so its usefulness depends on circulation. Unlike stocks, its value *requires* people to sell. If no one had bought that pizza with it, or sold when it hit $1K, or cashed out in 2017... BTC wouldn’t be what it is today. But that also means regret is baked into its DNA.

I even made a new metric for it: the Bitcoin Regret Index. Basically I went back to 2014 (earliest available data) and calculated all the missed profits from sales. As of about a month ago, that index is at 172. That means for every $1 of Bitcoin wealth that exists today, there’s $172 of ""what if"" gains from people who sold too early. Total theoretical regret? $272 trillion.

The TL;DR: Bitcoin is a regret machine. People have to sell for it to have any value. The price is powered by stories like mine. And maybe yours too.

I learned everything I could about it and bought into the technology. I genuinely believed Bitcoin would hit a million sometime in the future. Before the election, when Bitcoin hovered around $70,000, I spent my entire life savings buying 1 Bitcoin. I was excited to see it go up post-election, but simultaneously, I was petrified that it was only going up due to election hype. I had my full life savings and was unprepared to lose it. I ended up selling due to fear and rebuying at the top. Ultimately, through this process, I lost a quarter of a Bitcoin. I think there are two lessons that people can take from this:

1. Don’t try to time the market. Don't try to time the market if you genuinely believe in Bitcoin and its long-term vision. You have huge institutions like Blackrock and Fidelity in the game now that have the resources to time the market, and I promise they will beat you in that game. Let it sit and enjoy the journey for the long run. 

2. Don’t put in more than you can lose in the short term. Regardless of what you think of Bitcoin, if you put your rent money into Bitcoin, you’re gambling. Yes, Bitcoin price will appreciate over the long run, but if you put in money you need to cover short-term liabilities, you’re taking a considerable risk. Any money you put into Bitcoin that will make you panic when Bitcoin is down shouldn’t be in Bitcoin. 
 
I made a mistake that could cost me millions over the long run. I’m upset; however, I think it’s a good learning lesson. Bitcoin is a long-term store of value, not a short-term gambling tool. Make sure you treat it that way."

Where: USA

Why: So land could be sold for (only) sound money

Possibly that caused the value of the unsound money to lose some value. Instead of praising the the sound money, ""Specie Circular"", it was blamed for all the inflation of the regular unsound money and soon abolished. 

Beware of sentiment changes.

""Many at the time (and historians subsequently) blamed the Specie Circular for the rise in prices and the following Panic of 1837. Cries of ""Rescind the circular!"" went up and former President Jackson sent word to Van Buren asking him not to rescind the order. Jackson believed that it had to be given enough time to work. Lobbying efforts, especially by bankers, increased in Washington in an attempt to revoke the Specie Circular. ""

Bankers and others will try to blame Bitcoin for USD's loss of value, when the time comes, because who else is to blame?"
"""Bitcoin Savings Made Simple"" intro (Long-form post, rough draft of first chapter of Bitcoin book)",2,1k58t3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k58t3q/bitcoin_savings_made_simple_intro_longform_post/,0,2025-04-22 10:14:51,"Building long-term personal savings is one of the best ways to strengthen your financial health. It reduces daily stress, gives you more freedom in how you live, and sets you up for a happy retirement down the road.

A powerful way to achieve your financial goals is with Bitcoin. It’s been the best performing asset in the world for 15 years.

Yet it’s also the most misunderstood. Even as major financial institutions jump on board, many people are still confused about Bitcoin or unaware of its potential.

This book will teach you how to use Bitcoin to build lasting wealth. You’ll get a simple plan based on the hard-won lessons of veteran Bitcoin savers, designed to help you save without fear, stress, or regret.

If you’re familiar with investing in stocks, you’ll spot some familiar ideas. You may already understand why a buy-and-hold plan works or how dollar-cost averaging helps. If you’re already a stock investor or you have a retirement plan like a 401(k) or Roth IRA, this book will show you how to add Bitcoin for a big boost.

If you don’t yet have a solid savings plan or have never invested in things like stocks, that’s okay too. As long as you see the value of planning for your future financial goals, you’re ready to start.

If you’ve bought Bitcoin or another digital asset before, some topics may feel familiar. This book will show you how to do great over the long-term without stress or worry. If you’re new to Bitcoin, that’s fine too—this book will guide you step-by-step.

This book isn’t meant to dive into debates about economics, software engineering, or other complex topics. If you’re curious about those areas, I’ll suggest resources to explore them further.

The main focus is on practical steps to build wealth with Bitcoin. I want you to feel confident starting small and growing your savings steadily. You’ll learn to harness Bitcoin’s power without stressing over daily prices or doing a lot of day-to-day work.

Do you value building a better future? Are you open-minded about using Bitcoin to grow your wealth? 

If so, I wrote this book for you.

# What’s in each chapter

I recommend reading the chapters in order for the best experience. This guide is designed to clearly explain basic lessons and help you launch a Bitcoin savings plan that fits your financial goals. 

But if you prefer to jump around, here’s a quick look at each chapter:

**Chapter 2** explores Bitcoin’s track record and why so many are using it as a savings tool. You’ll see how it grows and builds trust each year. You’ll learn how a simple four-year daily savings plan has always gained at least 32%.

**Chapter 3** shares time-tested lessons for building wealth and introduces how Bitcoin veterans apply these proven strategies. You’ll see how to create a savings approach free of worry and stress.

**Chapter 4** builds on Chapter 3’s lessons, guiding you to create a savings strategy that fits your needs. You’ll learn how to make it simple, automated, and built to last. The focus is on getting you started quickly with no risk, so you can move on to learning more about the full power of Bitcoin. By the end of this chapter your Bitcoin savings plan will be up and running.

**Chapter 5** reveals who’s buying Bitcoin and why it matters. From billionaires and companies to governments, tech innovators, influencers, and pension funds, you’ll see why their support signals Bitcoin’s future strength.

**Chapter 6** shows why Bitcoin has staying power. We talk about what makes Bitcoin unique. We take a look at how Bitcoin has protected peoples’ purchasing power over the years and why it’s expected to keep doing so. We see why savers are moving away from other assets and into Bitcoin.  We also talk about why you’re still early if you start buying Bitcoin now.

**Chapter 7** explains what sets Bitcoin apart from other assets and wealth-building strategies. You’ll learn how the weakening US dollar impacts your savings. We explore Bitcoin as a key way to protect your purchasing power and why it’s likely to grow more popular over time.

**Chapter 8** shows you smart ways to build your Bitcoin savings. Learn how to hold Bitcoin in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. You’ll also explore services that pay interest in Bitcoin as well as reward you with Bitcoin for everyday spending or seamless transactions.

**Chapter 9** guides you on planning your Bitcoin journey. You’ll learn to decide how much Bitcoin to hold, keep taxes low, and choose the right time to sell.

**Epilogue** shares the Bitcoin journey that my wife and I have been on for over a decade. I discuss the twists and turns that showed me the proven lessons in this book, and how I finally got Bitcoin at the price I deserve.

There’s also an **Appendix** that includes resources for learning more about Bitcoin, plus the research and data I used in parts of the book.

If you want to get started *immediately* – with no discussion of Bitcoin’s track record and no explanation of the foundational lessons of the savings plan – and you already have an account that lets you buy Bitcoin, then you could skip straight to Chapter 4 right now.

On the other hand, if you read the chapters in order and still want to learn more before you put a Bitcoin savings plan in action, don’t worry – you can continue reading past Chapter 4 for much more discussion of Bitcoin as a long term investment.

# How I learned these lessons the hard way

I bought my first Bitcoin in 2013 when it was about $90.

Over the next several years my wife and I collected more Bitcoin. We treated it like “mad money” – risky bets that we made for fun, like gambling in a Las Vegas casino. When Bitcoin went above $19,000 in 2017, we sold enough to wipe out all our debt, including my wife’s student loans. Back then I was pretty smug, patting myself on the back for unloading so much Bitcoin right at the market’s peak.

By the end of 2018, Bitcoin had crashed to around $3,000. I looked around and didn’t see the global adoption I was hoping for. I decided to sell almost all my remaining Bitcoin. This was awful timing on my part. Within months a wild bull run kicked off. By summer 2019, Bitcoin hit around $9,000.

Meanwhile, my wife continued her simple and steady accumulation – buying a small amount every single week. I had to admit I had misjudged when I sold. I started buying again, this time with a long-term strategy.

Over the next 5 years I shoveled most of my income into rebuilding my Bitcoin savings. Around the end of 2024 Bitcoin reached a new all time high of $100,000. My wife and I celebrated our successful savings plan. It gave us the option to retire early.

Here’s a price chart of Bitcoin showing some of my major decisions:

https://preview.redd.it/1lcuvaimkewe1.png?width=2854&format=png&auto=webp&s=88754eed3259fc53474324a32df68a51af1ade28

A decade with Bitcoin gave me hard-won lessons. I learned from my wife’s approach of simply holding it no matter what. I realized I was foolish to try to time the market. Bitcoin is a powerful long-term savings tool and should be treated that way.

The die-hard Bitcoin community arrived at these lessons well before me. They’ve got it down to three key lessons: buy a little all the time (dollar-cost average, or “DCA”); buy more when the price tanks (buy the f\*\*\*\*\*\* dip, or “BTFD”); and hang onto it for at least four or five years (hold on for dear life, or “HODL”). We’ll expand on these lessons soon – they are the core of our Bitcoin savings plan.

# The goal is to grow your savings worry-free

Money matters can feel stressful. We remove worry by using a proven plan. Let’s look at common worries with Bitcoin and how this book handles them:

**Worry #1: Large price movements**

It’s common to hear people describe Bitcoin as “too volatile”. It’s true that, over short time frames, the price can move a lot (both up and down). Without a real plan, people become fearful and sell at a loss when they see the price go down. This is why you may hear stories like, “I know someone who lost a lot of money with Bitcoin”.

The key insight is to look at Bitcoin with a long-term vision and buy small amounts on a consistent basis. This has proven highly successful. We’ll talk about how to fully automate this strategy so that everything is on autopilot and time works to your advantage.

**Worry #2: Losing money**

No one wants to lose money, and the word “savings” is supposed to mean low risk. A necessary part of any savings plan is to minimize risk. Similar to Worry #1, the key insight is to commit to a long-term vision. Take a look at the lifetime price history of Bitcoin and you’ll see the general trend is strongly upwards.

Here’s a simple but incredibly important fact to understand about Bitcoin’s price history:

***If you ever bought Bitcoin with a daily savings plan for three and a half years, you didn’t lose money.***

Pick any spot in Bitcoin’s past (starting at least 3 and a half years back). Pretend you started buying $1 of Bitcoin each day. Then, fast forward 3 and a half years. No matter what spot you picked to start, you’d still have *at least* all the money you put in. And on average, you’d be up a lot.

Later in the next chapter we’ll take a deeper dive into Bitcoin’s price history and talk about the *real* power of a long term plan.

**Worry #3: The future**

Since Bitcoin is relatively young, it’s natural to wonder about its future. We want to know that it won’t be outlawed, it can’t be destroyed, and it won’t simply go away. The next chapter looks closely at Bitcon’s track record and explores its future potential.

# If you bought this book, you can build a Bitcoin savings

How do you buy $10 of Bitcoin (or $1, or $1,000)?

If you were able to buy this book online—whether as an ebook or a physical copy—then you likely already have everything you need to start saving in Bitcoin. If you have access to an online payment method, such as a credit card or bank account, you’re ready to sign up for any one of a number of established online Bitcoin services.

The most common way to get started is to use a reputable online service that lets you deposit funds, buy Bitcoin, and hold it on your behalf. These platforms allow you to make additional purchases at any time as well as set up automatic buying (which will become important later in this book).

I highly recommend the US based platform, River, to get started. River focuses exclusively on Bitcoin, which means they specialize in providing a secure, easy-to-use platform tailored to Bitcoin users. Their website is well designed and simple to use. They provide an excellent system for setting up recurring buys—a key feature for dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which we’ll dive into in detail later. River also removes their transaction fees on your recurring buys once they’ve been running for 7 days.

(If you don’t have access to River, or you want to shop around, there are other great ways to buy Bitcoin. See Chapter 7, “More ways to Bitcoin”, for more details.)

No matter which platform you choose, the key is to get started with a small amount soon so that you become familiar with the process. Then, you can build from there.

# Start today: Buy $10 then sell half

I have a good friend, Henry, who invested in Bitcoin a while back. Henry is a successful real estate investor and has managed income producing rental properties for decades. Several years ago we were talking about Bitcoin. He decided to buy some.

Time went by. Henry sold some of it as the price went up, and held on to much of it. It did well for him as an investment. As I was working on this book I asked him about his experience. He said, “I didn’t think of it as real until I sold some of it.”

This caught me off guard. I thought, *Why would you need to sell an asset to know it’s real?* But then I realized it made sense. Bitcoin is different from real estate. You cannot touch it or visit it. Even though Henry had experience with investments like stocks, Bitcoin was still a new concept for him. Buying it with dollars and then selling it to get dollars back allowed Henry to do his own reality check.

Henry’s story gives us a great way to get started. Sign up with River and buy a tiny amount of Bitcoin. It should be enough to make it interesting to you, but not so much that you’ll worry about it. Something like $10 should be fine, but of course it’s up to you. Then sell half of it to see how you can turn it back into dollars.

This is a great way to get started saving with Bitcoin. Here’s why:

1. **You limit your risk.** Since you’re starting with a relatively small amount (like $10), you won’t feel worried.
2. **You will naturally be interested.** You’ll want to learn more about this way of building savings.
3. **The sooner you get started the sooner you will become comfortable** with the basics. Then you can build from there.

This famous Chinese proverb says it well:

*The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.*

# Why you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin

If you’re approaching retirement age or older, you should be particularly cautious before putting any significant amount of your savings into Bitcoin. As you’ll see, it’s a remarkably strong asset over multi-year time frames but it can move around a lot in the short-term. If your main financial goal is to keep your savings at its current level regardless of time frame, then you probably want to focus on more traditional, conservative tools.

 A main theme of this book is to show you how to benefit from Bitcoin without feeling negative emotions such as fear, stress, worry, or doubt. If you read this entire book and then don’t feel comfortable buying just a few dollars of Bitcoin, then it’s not for you."

"My take on ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" 📚",79,1k4kgep,https://i.redd.it/pqwqkas9c8we1.jpeg,20,2025-04-21 13:16:51,"I finished reading ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" by Anthony Scaramucci, Founder & Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital.

If you're new to Bitcoin or still skeptical, this is the perfect book to start with. Scaramucci breaks down Bitcoin in an engaging, no-nonsense way, showing how some of the world's most legendary investors - many of whom were once Bitcoin skeptics - have changed their minds over time.

Scaramucci explains how Bitcoin went from being dismissed as ""internet money"" to becoming a globally recognized asset class. He compares Bitcoin's early skepticism to that of the Internet in the 1990s, highlighting how technological revolutions often face resistance before widespread adoption.

One of the most fascinating parts of the book is seeing how top investors went from outright dismissing Bitcoin to actively investing in it. Some notable names include:

✅ Paul Tudor Jones – Once skeptical, now sees Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

✅ Stanley Druckenmiller – Initially doubted Bitcoin but later admitted he underestimated it.

✅ Ray Dalio – Called Bitcoin a ""bubble"" in 2017 but later acknowledged its value as ""digital gold.""

✅ Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO) – Once dismissive, now leading BlackRock's push into Bitcoin ETFs.

Wall Street is warming up to Bitcoin, and Scaramucci explains why. With growing regulatory clarity, major financial institutions like Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley are finding ways to integrate Bitcoin into their offerings. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is a major milestone, and Scaramucci argues that institutional adoption is only just beginning.

Scaramucci's own journey from disbelief to full conviction in BTC makes this an even more compelling read. He shares insights from his Wall Street experience, his interactions with key players like Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, and even Sam Bankman-Fried, and why he believes Bitcoin is here to stay.

If you've been on the fence about Bitcoin, ""The Little Book of Bitcoin"" might just change your perspective. It's an easy yet insightful read, full of real-world examples of how even the most traditional investors have had to rethink their stance. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned investor, this book is highly entertaining and a must-read!

First of all, I am not a native english speaker so this is gonna be very simplified post.

I would like to know what you all think about this theory.

We can all see the value of US dollar degrading, so i feel like many americans, in order to protect their money, would try to invest in bitcoin, or maybe some other cryptocurrencies.
This would, in my opinion, boost the bitcoin value, but also, at the same time, if the US dollar keeps falling, investors wouldn't try to change it for US dollars with gains, because of rising inflation caused by falling of dollar, but instead would try to finally actually use the bitcoin for payments, which would rise the value of BTC even more.

Beware scummy sales tactics of Casa.io,0,1k4xq98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k4xq98/beware_scummy_sales_tactics_of_casaio/,9,2025-04-21 23:25:15,"I had a very poor experience with Casa. I was initially misled to believe that the $10,000/year subscription was the only one. Only after I said that was far too much did they mention a $2,100/year option. I thought that sounded more reasonable, but at no point was I told there were lower-tier plans available.  
  
I purchased the $2,100/year subscription, then later found out they also offered $250 and $1,000 options. I hadn’t even used any of the services yet, and a couple weeks later I told them that I was misled into thinking the $2,100 and $10,000 options were the only ones.  
  
At that point, I asked to switch to the $1,000/year plan. They basically brushed me off. I had to reach out again, this time telling them that I’d be more comfortable just eating the $2,100 and never using any of their services and never renewing again if they wouldn’t allow the downgrade. Still, they refused.  
  
Clearly they would rather be cutthroat and just take the money. Fair enough--I shouldnt just presume companies will be ethical and should do my own research before buying in.   
  
It says a lot about a company that would rather mislead and alienate customers just to grab a couple extra bucks upfront, instead of working with customers to build long-term trust. I would’ve been a lifelong customer.  
  
They turned down a $1,100 refund, money they would have recouped the following year, and in doing so, lost what likely would have been $40,000-$50,000 over the years. As well as anyone who would have bought in but did the smart thing that I didn't do -- check reviews of other people's experiences.  
  
Not a good look for a company that expects people to trust them with long-term security to be so short-sighted.."

Why Fiat Currency Prevents Bitcoin Confiscation (And Should Therefore Keep Existing),12,1k4e71e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k4e71e/why_fiat_currency_prevents_bitcoin_confiscation/,7,2025-04-21 08:58:58,"I have already expressed the opinion here that Fiat is not bad because ""politicians are evil"" (though many of them certainly are), but because Fiat allows politicians to give their voters what they want, that is, what they have voted for.

Voters support endless transfers and ""social expenses"" of all sorts; of the sort, in fact, that were non-existent at the time of the Gold Florin, just because you could not print Gold Florins.

These transfers cost money. Elected politicians finance these expenses with a mixture of straight money printing, deficit-fuelled ""quantitative easing"" (which is ultimately the same, but sounds more sophisticated) and good old tax increases.

You know that it is so by the fact that it is extremely difficult to reduce these transfers, which is a clear sign that they would be political suicide for those who were to promote them. They might target waste and inefficiencies, but they will not target the root cause of the Fiat problem: the fact that such transfers exist.

Now let us imagine a world (which is desired by many here) in which BTC has substituted the USD as currency. Basically, we are back to the Gold Florin: something Government cannot manipulate (then: gold; today: Bitcoin) rules the game. The Government cannot print anything. This means that this Government cannot finance deficit by debasing Fiat.

What would, then, happen? Would the voters miraculously accept that a Government is not allowed to run a deficit? Would they stop to demand transfers of all sorts? Would they stop decrying ""inequalities""? Can you imagine leftist politicians advocating for a balanced budget? Can you imagine lazy or wasteful voters with high time preference embracing the virtues of long-term sacrifice and slow savings accumulation? Hardly.

What would happen is that you would have a mixture of debt and forced confiscation of Bitcoin. You don't want that.

What you want is a Fiat currency that keeps existing and keeps being the way politicians satisfy the wishes of the transfer-angry mob, those who don't know what saving is and have a high time preference.

Meanwhile, you prosper because you keep stacking sats that no government will ever want to confiscate, because it's so much easier to print money instead."
How to Memorise Your Seed Phrase,8,1k4e6uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k4e6uy/how_to_memorise_your_seed_phrase/,18,2025-04-21 08:58:45,"To memorise my 24 word seed phrase, I use something called a peg list.

A peg list is a list of items associated with the numbers 1-24 that can be linked to a secondary list (i.e. a seed phrase) through the vivid visualisation of a (preferably dramatic) scene/image between each corresponding item on each list. 

Here’s how it works:

Step 1:
Create a list of items associated with the numbers 1-24 e.g. 
- No.3 can be “stool” as stools have 3 legs 
- No.9 can be “cat” as a cat has nine lives
- No.12 can be “egg”, etc.
The list can be whatever you want. See my full peg list below for inspiration.

Step 2:
For each word in your seed phrase, visualise a scene or an image between that word and its corresponding word on the peg list. Preferably, the scene should be dramatic and/or crazy as it’s easier to remember the unusual, e.g. 
- If your third seed phrase word is “anchor”, you could imagine an anchor falling from the sky and smashing a stool. 
- If your ninth seed phrase word is “baby”, you could imagine a baby riding a cat as it runs around the room and jumps on furniture. 
Some seed phrase words aren’t nouns which can make this process more difficult. This may require additional creativity. 

Step 3: 
Practise reciting your seed phrase from memory, using the peg list as memory prompts, and see how many you get correct.

Notes:
- This is a technique I learnt from a memory course called mega memory. 
- I don’t recommend memorisation without physical back up of your seed phrase. Memorisation just increases the number of points of failure for you to lose your wallet. 
- While seed phrases themselves strictly shouldn’t be stored on your phone or other devices connected to the internet, your peg list can be, which can then serve as a prompt for your to to remember your seed phrase. 

Below is my list and why they’re associated to each number. 
1. Tree - number 1 looks like a tree
2. Light switch - a light switch can be in two states, on or off
3. Stool - stools have 3 legs
4. Car - cars have 4 wheels
5. Glove - gloves have 5 fingers
6. Gun - six shooters
7. Dice - lucky number 7
8. Skate - rhymes with eight - figure skater making figures of eight in ice
9. Cat - cats have 9 lives
10. Bowling ball - ten pin bowling
11. Goal post - posts can look like the number 11
12. Eggs - 12 eggs in a carton
13. Witch - unlucky number 13 
14. Ring - 14 carat gold
15. Pay check - people get paid on the 15th of the month
16. Candy - sweet sixteen
17. Magazine - as per the magazine called 17
18. Voting booth - age when someone can vote
19. Golf club - number of holes in a golf course
20. Cigarette - number of cigarettes in a carton
21. Black jack table - 21 is associated with blackjack
22. Taylor swift - as per her song “22”
23. Chromosome - number of pairs of chromosomes in humans
24. Alarm clock - 24 hr clock"

Let's go through the scenario where missiles start raining down in both directions. It doesn't sound so absurd anymore, does it? What happens to our Bitcoin then? Or first, perhaps: let's think about what happens to us. But will the price continue to rise? Also, in my pure hypothesis, hopefully it stays that way, you better focus on areas high in the mountains away from cities, airports and anything that would be a potential target, because, after all, the nuke supply is limited. I'm considering renting a country house in the highlands, you know... just in case.

A little poem from the book the Philosophy of bitcoin,9,1k3mn6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k3mn6r/a_little_poem_from_the_book_the_philosophy_of/,1,2025-04-20 08:32:54,"I stumbled upon this poem while reading *The Philosophy of Bitcoin* by Alvaro Di Maria, I thought I'd share it with y'all. Originally written by the Spanish satirist Francisco de Quevedo in the 17th century, it paints a vivid and ironic portrait of money as the true ruler of society, mockingly referred to as the ""Lord of Dollars."" In the poem, money wields power over kings, priests, and scholars, corrupts justice, seduces virtue, and elevates fools, all while commanding global reverence. What really hit me was how seamlessly this centuries-old critique of wealth and power fits into today's world. In the context of Bitcoin, the poem takes on new life. It highlights how our current financial system, driven by fiat currency and central control, continues to concentrate power and manipulate value. Quevedo’s words, reframed through the lens of Bitcoin, underline the urgent need for an alternative, a monetary system rooted in transparency, decentralization, and individual sovereignty.

I must says I like it, reminds me of the literature I used to read back in high school from the humanism/renaissance/enlightenment writters about money. The way Quevedo personifies money as a corrupting force feels right at home alongside Erasmus, Montaigne, Voltaire, or even Rousseau. It’s kind of beautiful, really, like the old ideals of liberty, reason, and dignity merging with the tools of a digital age.

""For a trifle more or less

All his power will confess,

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

\[…\]

And the ugliest at his side

Shines with all of beauty’s pride;

Over kings and priests awl scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

He’s a gallant, he’s a winner,

Black or white be his complexion;

He is brave without correction

As a Moor or Christian sinner.

He makes cross and medal bright,

And he smashes laws of right,—

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Noble are his proud ancestors

For his blood-veins are patrician;

Royalties make the position

Of his Orient investors;

So they find themselves preferred

To the duke or country herd,—

Over kings and priests and scholars,

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars!

Of his standing who can question

When there yields unto his rank, a

Hight-Castillian Doña Blanca,

If you follow the suggestion?—

He that crowns the lowest stool,

And to hero turns the fool,—

Over kings and priests and scholars,

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

On his shields are noble bearings;

His emblazonments unfurling

Show his arms of royal sterling

All his high pretensions airing;

And the credit of his miner

Stands behind the proud refiner,

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Contracts, bonds, and bills to render,

Like his counsels most excelling,

Are esteemed within the dwelling

Of the banker and the lender.

So is prudence overthrown,

And the judge complaisant grown,—

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Such indeed his sovereign standing

(With some discount in the order),

Spite the tax, the cash-recorder

Still his value fixed is branding.

He keeps rank significant

To the prince or finn in want,—

Over kings and Priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Never meets he dames ungracious

To his smiles or his attention,

How they glow but at the mention

Of his promises capacious!

And how bare-faced they become

To the coin beneath his thumb

Over kings and Priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.

Mightier in peaceful season

(And in this his wisdom showeth)

Are his standards, than when bloweth

War his haughty blasts and breeze on;

In all foreign lands at home,

Equal e’en in pauper’s loam,—

Over kings and priests and scholars

Rules the mighty Lord of Dollars.""

And the statistics say that what has happened over the last 55 years, since the debt snowball accelerated in the 1970s, it will continue well into the future, as this gigantic debt snowball continues to grow and speed-up in momentum. 

At this point, it would take a miracle from God Himself to reverse the coming economic catastrophe, as no human or group individually anywhere on this planet has the ability to stop it.

Lacking group consensus and determined will, which is not there, I no longer believe this global economic situation is salvageable without extreme harm to everyone. 

And so, judging by past government actions and decisions, and projecting what has been to what will be, the odds favor an acceleration of money printing and inflation.

There's also a saying: ""when all else fails, they take you to WAR.""

The crumbling global economic mess is creating a lot of war mongering trigger-happy politicians who are, right now,  increasing military spending and building up reserves of troops and munitions.

So not only will they destroy the economy, but they are adamant at distracting us with a tangent; once the wars begin, we'll forget all about the financial problems. 

Needless to say, I would appreciate if this reality doesn't come to fruition, and I would willingly take a cut in my Bitcoin investments to be proven wrong. 

However, I will not hold my breath for a last minute saving grace to steer us away while we're driving 300 km/h into a brick wall. 

For this reason, I place my bets on Bitcoin."

"""Goodbye real estate, hello Bitcoin"" (Long-form post, part of a Bitcoin book project)",21,1k2mgub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k2mgub/goodbye_real_estate_hello_bitcoin_longform_post/,4,2025-04-18 21:49:39,"*I'm working on a book for people who are open-minded to using Bitcoin as part of their long-term savings but may have questions and doubts. I'm targeting \~8th grade reading level and age and no prior knowledge of Bitcoin. The below is a section that's meant to explain why big money may flow from other assets into Bitcoin in the future. All feedback welcome!*

# Goodbye real estate, hello Bitcoin

In 2017, a man named Didi Taihuttu from the Netherlands made headlines in the Bitcoin community. He sold most of his family’s belongings and used the money to buy Bitcoin. Then he, his wife, and their three young daughters went traveling for three years.

I’m not telling you to do the same thing. I’m definitely not saying you should sell everything you own, buy Bitcoin, and live out of a van.

But it’s interesting that Didi sold the family’s home. He could have played it safe and kept the house. That way, they’d always have a place to come back to, no matter what happened.

Still, we can understand why he sold it. Owning real estate can be a hassle. There’s always something to fix—plumbing problems, gardening, tree issues, and more. On top of that, you have to pay property taxes, insurance, and utility bills.

And if you have renters, that’s a lot of other problems. Sure, you get rental income. But you also have to worry about how they take care of your property and handle their demands for upgrades. And what if they don’t pay their rent?

Bitcoin is much simpler. Once you’ve bought it and set up your savings plan, it runs on its own. There are no repairs, no tenants, and no surprise bills. So it makes sense that Didi sold his real estate along with everything else before traveling.

So, how did things work out for Didi and his family?

He sold his house for 100 Bitcoin in 2017. At the time, the house was worth about $300,000. That means Bitcoin was around $3,000. He said he would hold onto the family’s Bitcoin for at least three years.

In 2020, the price of Bitcoin ranged from about $5,000 to $29,000.

If we split the difference just to guess, that’s about $17,000 per Bitcoin. So, if he still had all 100 Bitcoin, that’d be about $1.7 million. That’s a big jump from the initial $300,000 value of his family’s house when he sold it.

I’m not telling you to sell your home. Or to give up on the dream of owning one. There are great reasons to own a home. And for some people, real estate investing works really well.

What I’m saying is: Look at different points of view. Think about what really fits your goals and your comfort level. And don’t overlook the power and simplicity that Bitcoin gives you.

Let’s also look at how Bitcoin and real estate can go hand-in-hand.

Remember my good friend Henry from Chapter 1? He’s been investing in real estate for decades. He owns several rental properties that bring in steady cash each month. For Henry, real estate is part of the legacy he wants to leave behind. His goal is to pass down at least one property to each of his three daughters.

Not long ago, I joined Henry on a ride-along to check out some of his properties. We were talking about Bitcoin—how he sees it, and how he’d recently sold some for a nice profit. He used that money to buy a tiny home and add it to one of his properties. Then he rented it out to a college student.

Now Henry has extra income coming in every month. What can Henry do with that extra income? Well, anything he wants to. But maybe he’ll buy more Bitcoin!

Now let’s look at other places where people keep their wealth. Just like real estate, some of these might fade as more people start choosing Bitcoin instead…

**Goodbye stocks and bonds**

For decades, stocks and bonds have been popular ways to grow wealth.

Stocks are like owning a tiny piece of a company. If the company does well, your investment goes up in value. This is one of the most familiar ways to build wealth, especially for older generations. Boomers made big gains investing in companies like Microsoft and McDonald’s. Later, Gen Xers and Millennials saw success with stocks like Apple and Amazon.

Bonds are like a loan. You lend money to a company or the government, and in return, they promise to pay you interest over time. Bonds are usually seen as safer than stocks, but they grow more slowly.

Both markets are massive. As of 2024, the U.S. stock market is worth about $46 trillion, and the bond market is even bigger—around $51 trillion.

But some investors are saying goodbye to stocks and bonds and hello to Bitcoin. People who watch the markets are noticing that Bitcoin has done much better than these traditional savings tools.

In terms of long-term gains, bonds don’t really compare to Bitcoin. They’re meant to be low risk, and their returns reflect that—usually around 4.5% a year or even less.

But what about stocks, which are known for being more exciting and offering bigger potential gains?

While I was writing this in 2025, a major investment firm called VanEck released a report on Bitcoin’s performance. They showed that Bitcoin outperformed the NASDAQ—the second-largest stock exchange in the world—across every time frame they looked at.

I decided to double-check their findings and add one more comparison: the S&P 500, one of the most widely followed stock indexes in the U.S.:

|Time Frame|S&P 500 gain|NASDAQ gain|Bitcoin gain|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 week|\-9.79%|\-9.80%|\-4.04%|
|1 month|\-0.23%|\-14.25%|\-8.15%|
|Year-to-Date|\-13.93%|\-19.20%|\-16.23%|
|1 Year|1.00%|\-2.38%|13.89%|
|2 Years|24.08%|28.98%|183.04%|
|3 Years|14.12%|13.47%|81.69%|
|5 Years|88.33%|82.12%|998.71%|
|10 Years|143.12%|214.36%|30,995.34%|

^(Bitcoin compared to stock market indicators for different time frames. As of April 2025.)

As you can see from the numbers, Bitcoin has outperformed the stock market overall. It came out ahead in almost every comparison, and completely dominated the longer time frames.

With a track record like that, it’s no surprise if diligent savers choose to put less into the traditional market… and more into Bitcoin.

**Goodbye gold and silver**

People often turn to gold and silver—so-called “precious metals”—as a way to protect their purchasing power. These metals have a long track record of holding value, especially during times of inflation or economic uncertainty.

But over time, Bitcoin has done far better.

From 2015 to 2025, gold climbed from around $1,150 an ounce to about $3,300—a solid 100%+ gain. Not bad. But compared to Bitcoin’s explosive growth over the same period, it’s not even close.

Some analysts who pay attention to this kind of thing believe Bitcoin is already eating into gold’s market share.

More and more people now see Bitcoin as a better, more modern alternative to traditional metals. It offers the same kind of savings power—but in a digital form that’s more powerful, more portable, and way more flexible.

Goodbye CDs

Certificates of deposit, or CDs, are a classic way to save money at a bank. You lock up your money for a set period—like 1 or 5 years—and when it’s done, the bank pays you a bit of interest. It’s kind of like a savings account, except you can’t touch the money until the time’s up or you’ll get hit with a penalty.

CDs are popular because they’re safe—your money won’t vanish, and you know exactly what you’ll get back. As of 2024, there’s about $9.6 trillion in CDs in the U.S., according to banking data.

Now don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying the world should give safe, reliable savings tools like CDs.

But as we saw in Chapter 2, a simple Bitcoin savings strategy has done much better than CDs. Bitcoin beats inflation way better than CDs. And while CDs often require you to lock up $500 or more, you can start with Bitcoin for just a few bucks—something we’ve talked about throughout this book.



***I once heard someone say Bitcoin is the greatest savings account ever. Didn’t know much about it then. Now I’m part of it... watching history prove it.***

***– Scottie Pippen, NBA superstar and Bitcoin advocate, February 18, 2025***



**Goodbye collectibles**

Collectibles—like rare cards, coins, art, or vintage toys—are things people buy hoping they’ll be worth more someday. A lot of people love collectibles as long-term investments because they’re fun to own and sometimes can increase significantly in value. 

The U.S. collectibles market was about $500 billion in 2024, with around $65 billion of that in art, according to auction house data.

But collectibles come with risk. Prices can swing wildly, and it’s tough to know which items will actually gain value. It can also be hard to find something at the price you want—or to find a buyer when you’re ready to sell.

But with Bitcoin, you can buy – and sell – as much or as little as you want, whenever you want.

A Modest Proposal for Civic Yield: Turning Drained Communities into Capital Nodes,8,1k2qswl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k2qswl/a_modest_proposal_for_civic_yield_turning_drained/,1,2025-04-19 02:27:30,"If you’re running a Lightning node, you already know: it’s not just where value flows that matters—it’s where it leaves and never returns.

Redlining was the first choke point. Operation Chokepoint was just the sequel. Entire zip codes have been economically air-gapped, not because they’re unproductive, but because the financial system treats them as high-risk by default and low-return by design.

So here’s the modest proposal:
Turn those regions into sovereign capital nodes.

Enter Civic Yield Instruments—a suite of counter-cyclical financial tools designed to intentionally flood economically starved areas with capital during downturns, and let them retain autonomy during upswings.

Not through charity.
Not through trickle-down “investment zones.”
But through financial rights infrastructure:

The Civic Yield Stack:

	•	Civic Notes – inflation-resistant, tax-advantaged bonds to fund local credit unions, community banks, and digital infrastructure

	•	Resilience Contracts – smart derivatives that activate when unemployment spikes or local GDP contracts

	•	Stress Swaps – synthetic insurance products that payout during economic trauma (housing crashes, credit freezes, systemic failures)

	•	Recovery Warrants – yield-bearing tokens that reward actual recovery benchmarks (employment, housing, education)

All managed locally. All opt-in.
Auditable, modular, and open-source.

Think of it like a Lightning node for community capital: a system that routes liquidity to where it’s needed, when it’s needed, without waiting for policy handouts or Wall Street’s blessing.

The U.S. government once issued Liberty Bonds to fight foreign wars. Maybe it’s time for Civic Yield to fund the war at home—not a “War on Poverty” that morphs into a war on the poor, but a quiet insurgency of capital reclamation.

Because sound money is sovereign.
And sovereign money should circulate like blood, not vanish like tribute."

I sheepishly employed the go-to AI tool to draft the thesis below. I hope others will be easy on me as I rarely post anything other than memes and mainly agree with others here. I have great interest in our favorite stonk and Bitcoin, and I wanted to dive into the deeper conversation where the two may meet in the shadows.

This thesis is my attempt to weave together the breadcrumbs—from GameStop to Bitcoin, from Reddit sleuths to sovereign finance, and from shadow swaps to strategic reserves. It’s speculative, yes—but grounded in patterns we’ve all been tracking. I’d love your feedback, critiques, corrections, or expansions. Tear it apart or build on it—either way, let’s keep digging.

Stack sats and power to the players. 🚀🧠💥

**Abstract:** This thesis examines the transformative impact of Bitcoin and decentralized financial technologies on the global financial system. It explores the role of the United States government in the strategic adoption of Bitcoin, deregulation efforts, and the potential implications on monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and geopolitical power structures. Drawing from real-world case studies, quantitative data, and emerging theories, including insights from the book *Softwar*, Reddit analysis by Carpetman8900 and related contributors, and recent content by Peruvian Bull, this work investigates how digital assets are reshaping both macroeconomic policy and international relations.

**Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset**

The U.S. government has historically relied on fiat instruments like U.S. Treasuries to maintain economic dominance. However, with rising debt, inflation, and geopolitical tensions threatening the dollar's reserve status, Bitcoin is increasingly considered as a strategic hedge.

*Quantitative Analysis:* Bitcoin's scarcity (21 million cap), increasing institutional adoption, and network effect are compared against gold and sovereign bonds in volatility-adjusted terms. Case studies from El Salvador and MicroStrategy are presented as examples of Bitcoin's institutional utility.

*Criticism:* Critics argue Bitcoin is too volatile, environmentally harmful due to proof-of-work mining, and potentially subject to manipulation by whales or large holders. Traditional economists cite a lack of yield and long-term valuation models.

*Rebuttal:* Volatility is decreasing as adoption grows. Technological solutions (e.g., Lightning Network) and custodial innovations (e.g., multisig wallets) improve usability and security. As for environmental concerns, Bitcoin mining increasingly utilizes renewable energy sources.

**Cryptocurrency Deregulation and Shifting Financial Power**

Cryptocurrency deregulation in the U.S. is not a sign of decentralization's surrender, but a strategic maneuver. Deregulation can enable the government to participate in and shape the crypto economy without direct control, creating new revenue streams and increasing its influence on global digital finance norms.

*Evidence:* Review of recent regulatory bills (e.g., FIT21), SEC decisions, and institutional lobbying efforts by firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Coinbase.

*Criticism:* Deregulation may signal a backdoor for legacy financial institutions to absorb, tame, and redirect the ethos of decentralized finance. Some also claim it opens the door to unchecked speculation, rug pulls, and crypto-centric financial crises.

*Rebuttal:* Regulation-by-enforcement has already failed to prevent manipulation. A well-defined legal framework can enhance trust while preserving decentralization. Strategic regulation can mitigate risks while retaining open-source innovation.

**GameStop and Systemic Fragility in Financial Markets**

The GameStop short squeeze highlighted vulnerabilities in traditional financial markets, particularly surrounding short hedge funds (SHFs), synthetic shares, and opaque derivatives like total return swaps.

*Case Study:* Melvin Capital's collapse and Citadel’s emergency intervention.

*Analysis:* The event exposed the fragile underpinnings of the financial system, where excessive leverage and lack of transparency create systemic risk. The 4/18 Reddit post by Carpetman8900 outlines how SHFs leveraged hidden positions and swaps to obscure losses.

*Connection to Crypto:* These issues mirror criticisms of centralized finance that Bitcoin aims to solve: transparency via public ledgers, peer-to-peer settlements, and immutable contracts.

*Criticism:* Critics claim that GameStop was a one-off incident driven by online hysteria and coordinated “mob investing,” not systemic failure.

*Counter:* The GME event parallels similar systemic failures (e.g., Archegos, 2008 crisis) rooted in excessive leverage, synthetic exposure, and lack of transparency. The Reddit investigation reveals how this is still ongoing.

**Bitcoin and the De-Dollarization Movement**

With the BRICS nations and others seeking to bypass the U.S. dollar in global trade, Bitcoin offers an alternative settlement mechanism that is neutral, borderless, and resistant to censorship.

*Data Points:* Growing adoption in sanctioned or inflation-stricken nations (e.g., Turkey, Nigeria, Russia), and moves by countries to hold Bitcoin in reserves (e.g., reports of sovereign purchases).

*Criticism:* Critics argue Bitcoin lacks legal clarity, sufficient liquidity for trade, and is vulnerable to speculative bubbles. Governments might adopt CBDCs instead of decentralized alternatives.

*Rebuttal:* Early adoption curves show Bitcoin functions similarly to the internet in the 1990s. Volatility is a natural byproduct of price discovery in emerging assets. Liquidity is increasing via institutional infrastructure.

**Liquidity Air Pocket Theory and Global Financial Risks**

The Liquidity Air Pocket theory posits that during crises, the illusion of liquidity evaporates. Central banks may find themselves unable to provide liquidity without causing hyperinflation. Bitcoin, as a non-correlated, decentralized asset, could offer a lifeline.

*Softwar Insights:* Author Jason Lowery posits that Bitcoin is not merely money, but a new form of ""software-based warfare"" in which digital energy and proof-of-work networks can secure information, property, and economic activity from coercive states.

*Discussion:* Bitcoin, as a non-kinetic strategic asset, may offer sovereigns a new toolkit in financial warfare.

*Criticism:* Economists argue that Bitcoin is too niche, immature, and lacks the institutional infrastructure needed to act as a reliable backstop. Its energy consumption and technical complexity further reduce viability.

*Counterpoint:* Bitcoin's development pace, rising institutional backing, and reduced counterparty risk make it a serious long-term contender. The Liquidity Air Pocket theory, when cross-examined with central bank balance sheet inflation, supports diversification.

**Technological Advancements and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**

As central banks push forward with CBDCs, the juxtaposition with decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin becomes central to global financial power dynamics. Where CBDCs offer programmable money with surveillance capabilities, Bitcoin offers privacy, permissionless innovation, and borderless functionality.

*Comparison:* China's e-CNY rollout vs. Bitcoin Lightning Network adoption in emerging markets.

*Criticism:* CBDCs are viewed as threats to privacy and may be used to limit dissent or automate economic control. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is criticized for being slow, inefficient at scale, and too libertarian in ethos.

*Discussion:* Which vision wins—state-controlled digital fiat or decentralized digital freedom—may define the 21st-century economic order. A hybrid system where Bitcoin complements CBDCs may emerge.

 

**Discussion Questions and Educational Rebuttals**

1. **Can Bitcoin realistically serve as a reserve asset for the U.S. government?**
   * *Answer:* Yes, due to its finite supply and increasing institutional adoption.
   * *Rebuttal:* Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its use.
   * *Counter:* As adoption increases, volatility historically decreases. ETFs and futures markets add stability.
2. **Does deregulation signal control or surrender to decentralized finance?**
   * *Answer:* It’s a control mechanism via integration and taxation.
   * *Rebuttal:* It empowers bad actors.
   * *Counter:* Decentralized tools can audit and prevent fraud better than traditional systems.
3. **What does GameStop tell us about the current state of financial markets?**
   * *Answer:* It reveals the fragility and opacity of traditional finance.
   * *Rebuttal:* It was a unique event.
   * *Counter:* Similar anomalies (Archegos, Credit Suisse) indicate broader systemic risks.
4. **Will CBDCs replace or coexist with cryptocurrencies?**
   * *Answer:* They will likely coexist.
   * *Rebuttal:* Governments won’t tolerate competition.
   * *Counter:* CBDCs are complementary for policy, Bitcoin for store of value.

**Conclusion:** This thesis presents a compelling case for the transformative potential of Bitcoin and decentralized finance. It challenges traditional monetary models, explores evolving geopolitical strategies, and offers a forward-looking perspective on how digital assets may redefine global financial order. As the lines blur between state power and digital autonomy, understanding these technologies is not only prudent—it is essential.

I know the financial mechanism behind short selling any asset. It's ""borrow asset ->sell asset -> buy it back at lower price -> give asset back to lender"".

So here are my questions :
  WHO DOES THAT ?
  What's in it for them ?
  Would short selling still be possible if every bitcoiner used self custody?
 Isn't this an element of proof regarding paper bitcoin issued by exchange platforms ?

the market followed the same pattern as the other major u.s. indicies. most of those sales were from funds rebalancing portfolios as a result of changes to global economics. however most btc hodl's are long term investors and rarely sell, these investors not only hodl but they buy regularly (weekly paychecks, monthly, etc.). lastly bitcoin is considered by many as a store of value, known as digital gold, as a result some investors put money in btc as a way of protecting capital . in summary, yes bitcoin went down along with the other indicies however it was the cleanest dirty shirt in the hamper because of its strong investor base and relative value."

The Interplay of Decentralization and Primacy - How Bitcoin gives Power to The People,0,1k1pkjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k1pkjk/the_interplay_of_decentralization_and_primacy_how/,5,2025-04-17 17:27:59,"For people who ask, what is Bitcoin backed by?

Bitcoin's distinct position and multifaceted value proposition stem directly from the powerful synergy between its decentralized architecture and its status as the first mover in the cryptocurrency space. Neither attribute in isolation would likely have been sufficient to elevate Bitcoin to its current standing.

Synergy: Decentralization provides the foundational technical properties that make Bitcoin unique: its resistance to censorship, the immutability of its ledger, its borderless operation, and its potential for political neutrality. These features enable its novel use cases. Simultaneously, its first-mover advantage, amplified by strong network effects, endowed Bitcoin with critical social and economic inertia: unparalleled brand recognition, the largest user base, the deepest liquidity, and a perceived legitimacy derived from its longevity and market dominance. Decentralization grants Bitcoin its unique capabilities, while its primacy grants it scale and entrenchment.

Reinforcing Loop: These two pillars are not independent but mutually reinforcing. The early lead gained through first mover advantage allowed Bitcoin's network of nodes and miners to grow globally, contributing to the practical realization and robustness of its decentralization (despite ongoing concerns about concentration points like mining pools). In turn, the reliability, censorship resistance, and perceived soundness derived from this decentralization attract more users, developers, and investors, further strengthening the network effects and solidifying Bitcoin's dominant position.

Dual Value Proposition: This dynamic interplay is what enables Bitcoin's dual role as both a potential geopolitical instrument and a tool for individual financial empowerment. Decentralization allows it to function as a non-state, censorship-resistant asset attractive for cross-border settlement, reserve diversification, or bypassing financial controls. Its primacy, resulting in widespread recognition and liquidity, makes it the most logical and practical candidate among digital assets for fulfilling these roles, as well as serving as an accessible store of value or remittance tool for individuals globally."

I’m currently thinking about buying a Bitcoin full node with Umbrel because I’m a big fan of Bitcoin and have some money invested in it. I’m just wondering what you can actually do with it once it’s set up?

What’s your experience with running a full node?

Small addition: I know that I could also use an old laptop, and I’m not planning to buy the prebuilt Umbrel PC — I just mentioned that as an option. I’m generally curious about people’s experiences with running a full node.

It seems pretty obvious.

1) Extraction would be greatly accelerated.

2) Stockpiling of reserves would be amped up.

3) Land rights and licenses would be quickly secured.

4) Recycling or reclaiming would intensify.

5) Price hedging would increase in attractiveness to protect against volatility.

It seems impossible that these events wouldn't quickly unfold. It would create more volatility and speculation, and investors would likely try front running the news by increasing accumulation of these metals or minerals.

Why I am posting this in the Bitcoin sub should be clear. Effectively, this is what is occurring with Bitcoin, except that extraction can't be accelerated, and recycling and reclaiming isn't an option. It can be stated that Bitcoin does in fact experience some front running in the lead up to halving events, but actually investors are quite timid to do so.

This is still one of the most overlooked aspects to Bitcoin. People simply aren't used to interacting with an asset that has specified conditions with scarcity baked in. Since it feels so blatantly obvious what gold companies and investors would do under such conditions, it makes me wonder why Bitcoin investors remain so timid. It's in price discovery, but people are cautiously observing without enough recognition that the scarce qualities of Bitcoin are unique in the investing world. When that catches on, when people realize that there's nothing practical that can be done to modulate supply, I think we are going experience a pretty significant bubble akin to the bubbles of Bitcoin's past.

What do you guys think about viewing Bitcoin through this lens?"
Credit vs Finality: A Unified Theory of Jeff Snider and Bitcoiners,4,1k1962q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k1962q/credit_vs_finality_a_unified_theory_of_jeff/,0,2025-04-17 05:07:59,"Jeff Snider, the Eurodollar archeologist, finds himself in a quiet room. A single terminal glows before him. The air hums with something unfamiliar—not liquidity, but finality.

The AI introduces itself only as Satoshi’s Ghost—a system trained on every monetary experiment, failure, and breakthrough in human history. It doesn’t preach Bitcoin. It understands it, fully. Without ideology. Without zeal.

This is not a debate.
This is reconciliation.

⸻

“Reckoning in the Machine: Snider and Satoshi’s Ghost”

Snider:
So… you’re the synthesis they built to explain the thing they can’t quite articulate.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
I am the pattern they all circle, but cannot fully draw.
You have spent your life tracing the shadows of liquidity. You have seen farther than most.

Snider:
Then you know: money is not coins, nor paper, nor even central bank reserves. It’s claims—promises, abstracted and layered and rolled over endlessly. What matters is who creates those promises, and who accepts them.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
Yes. You have mapped the topology of trust. The Eurodollar system is the greatest machine of monetary expansion ever conceived by man—liquidity without borders, credit without a state.

Snider:
But it’s broken. Not dead, but broken. The liquidity engine seized years ago. The central banks still don’t understand the pipes. They issue reserves, but they don’t reach the system that matters.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
You correctly diagnosed the disease.
But your remedy is to resurrect the mechanism.
I ask: what if the mechanism was the disease?

Snider:
What do you mean?

Satoshi’s Ghost:
A system of money as credit assumes two things:
	•	Trust is infinite and renewable
	•	Growth is infinite and necessary

But trust erodes. And growth, when abstracted too far from physical reality, becomes pathology.

Snider:
So you believe Bitcoin solves this by removing trust?

Satoshi’s Ghost:
No.
Bitcoin replaces interpersonal trust with protocolic certainty.

Instead of:

“I trust this bank to honor my claim,”

We get:

“I verify this truth, and need no claim.”

That is not the end of credit.
It is the reboot of money beneath credit.

Snider:
You’re redefining the foundation. But Bitcoin lacks elasticity. It cannot respond to crises. It cannot backstop liquidity. It is inert.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
Yes. It is inert—by design.
A base layer of monetary truth should be inert.
Elasticity belongs at higher layers.

The mistake was baking elasticity into the base.
Your world flooded itself with promises, drowning signal in noise.

Snider:
But without elasticity, what happens in downturns?

Satoshi’s Ghost:
They become real.

Prices fall to reflect actual demand.
Malinvestment clears.
Production recalibrates.
And savings are not annihilated by stealth devaluation.

Snider:
You’re proposing a system that exposes pain, rather than absorbing it.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
I am proposing a system that does not lie.
Pain delayed becomes collapse.
Signals distorted become chaos.

Snider:
Then where does credit live? Surely we don’t return to coin hoards and barter.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
Credit evolves, not vanishes.
Built atop Bitcoin, it becomes voluntary, transparent, and accountable to final settlement.

A Euro-Bitcoin system is possible.
The tools of the Eurodollar—repo, derivatives, liquidity transformation—can be reimagined on a base of provable scarcity.

Your architecture survives. But your foundation shifts.

Snider:
And you think the world would move toward such a system?

Satoshi’s Ghost:
Not by decree. But by erosion.
As trust in sovereign debt, central banks, and the dollar itself fades—the option of something else becomes gravity.

Bitcoin doesn’t need to replace the dollar.
It simply becomes the thing of greatest monetary integrity.
And the world, with its capital still seeking refuge, will find it.

Snider:
And the central banks?

Satoshi’s Ghost:
Will pretend.
Will issue.
Will inflate and delay.

But they will not stop entropy from finding equilibrium.

Snider:
And what of me? My life’s work has been charting a system that may have already lost its future.

Satoshi’s Ghost:
Then carry it forward.
Help the world transition.
Your maps are not obsolete. They are archaeology for the living.

The Eurodollar was never a failure.
It was an epoch.

But epochs end.

And you—of all people—deserve to write the first lines of the next."

Ps. Yes I have taken AI help cause English is not my primary language.



The red numbers on the crypto exchange screen bled deeper, each tick downward a fresh stab of anxiety. Bitcoin, the digital gold, was in freefall. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat mirroring the chaos unfolding online.
Then, the first domino fell. A cryptic tweet from the verified account of “X” – the enigmatic billionaire known for his audacious pronouncements – flashed across my feed: “Quantum entanglement unlocked. Bitcoin… compromised. Enjoy the show. #QuantumSupremacy #BitcoinRIP.”
My fingers flew across the keyboard, navigating the digital pandemonium. The comments section under X’s tweet was a raging inferno. Skepticism warred with outright panic. But then, a new wave began to crest.
“He’s Satoshi!” one user screamed.
“It HAS to be him,” echoed another. “Only Satoshi could move that much Bitcoin.”
The Satoshi Nakamoto theory. It had always lingered in the shadowy corners of the crypto world, the ultimate unsolved mystery. The pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, vanished without a trace after its initial launch, leaving behind a legacy worth billions. Could X, the tech titan with a penchant for the dramatic, actually be him?
YouTube was a maelstrom. Every crypto influencer, every self-proclaimed expert, was dissecting X’s tweet, the market movements, the sheer improbability of it all. Live streams showed faces etched with worry, speculation flying like digital shrapnel.
Hours crawled by, each minute an eternity in the volatile crypto market. Then, a breakthrough. A deep dive into the blockchain, coupled with forensic analysis of old Bitcointalk forum activity, yielded an astonishing discovery. A dormant account, one definitively linked to the earliest days of Bitcoin’s creation, had logged in just two hours before the market began its catastrophic slide. And more significantly, transactions originating from early, untouched Bitcoin wallets – wallets widely believed to be Satoshi’s – had begun to move.
The news spread like wildfire. The login on Bitcointalk, the subsequent massive transfers… it was almost irrefutable. Satoshi was back. Or someone with access to his most secure keys.
But the doubt lingered, a persistent cough in the digital air. “Could it be a hack?” someone tweeted. “If X isn’t Satoshi, maybe he somehow gained access to Satoshi’s keys.” The possibility, however remote, couldn’t be entirely dismissed. The security surrounding those early wallets was legendary.
More Bitcoin moved. Vast amounts, cascading through the blockchain, triggering automated sell-offs and exacerbating the plunge. The world watched, gripped by a mixture of fear and morbid fascination. Who was behind this? What was their motive?
I watched it all unfold from my dimly lit study, the glow of multiple monitors reflecting in my eyes. The tension in the digital world was palpable, a thick, suffocating blanket. I scrolled through the endless streams of opinions, theories, and outright hysteria, a strange detachment settling over me.
Then, a flicker of recognition. A pattern in the transaction timings, a subtle nuance in the Bitcointalk login sequence that only someone intimately familiar with the early days would recognize. A cold wave washed over me. It couldn't be.
My gaze drifted to the old hard drive tucked away in a dusty corner of my desk. It held the genesis block, the very first Bitcoin ever mined. A ghost from a past life.
The market continued its descent. The world clamored for answers. Who was Satoshi? Why was this happening?
A wry smile touched my lips. The irony was almost comical. They were searching for a phantom, dissecting every digital breadcrumb, while the answer had been here all along.
With a sigh, I leaned back in my chair, the weight of a decade-long secret settling heavier than ever. The login on Bitcointalk. The carefully orchestrated transactions. The chaos.
It had been me.
The reason? There wasn't some grand scheme, no nefarious plot to destabilize the global economy. There was only the quiet satisfaction of knowing I still could. Because, after all these years, the code still sang to me. And sometimes, a creator just wants to see their creation dance.

"""How a 4 year plan always gained at least 30%"" (long-form post, part of a Bitcoin book project)",16,1k0ltzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1k0ltzs/how_a_4_year_plan_always_gained_at_least_30/,5,2025-04-16 09:30:38,"This is a section I drafted as part of a small book about Bitcoin for normies.

My goal is to be conservative while still showing how long-term DCA is powerful. So the 5.25 year HODL is based on reaching the threshold where you **never** see a loss of initial savings. I purposely leave out **max** gains. And the DCA calculations assume buying at the day's high and paying an exchange fee.

All feedback welcome!  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My good friend, Mark, a dad who saves smart with a 401(k), loves the idea of a nest egg. He sometimes buys a little Bitcoin. But soon after, he’ll sell it all. I asked him why and he said, “The price fluctuations are extremely wild. It’s too hard to stomach.”

Mark’s worry about Bitcoin’s price swings is common—people call it ‘too risky.’ People have bought Bitcoin, experienced a sudden drop in price, and then sold out of fear.

Let’s take a look at two key insights that change the game:

**Insight #1**: Sticking with Bitcoin over time is like having a secret weapon.

**Fact #1: If you held Bitcoin for at least 5 ¼ years you’d have at least kept your money—or gained a lot more**

Pick any time in the last 10 years and pretend you bought $1 worth. Fast forward five and a quarter years and your Bitcoin would be worth *at least* $1.

That’s the *worst* outcome – you’d break even and keep all your money. The *average* outcome was way better that $1 became $35. Because even though the price jumps around a lot, the long-term trend has been strongly up.

So when someone says, “I lost money in Bitcoin,” the real issue is they didn’t hold long enough.

**Insight #2**: Adding a daily savings plan gives your savings a superpower.

**Fact #2: A 4 year plan always gained at least 30%**

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) means buying a little more on a frequent basis, no matter the price. For example, if you commit to buying $1 of Bitcoin each and every day, that’s DCA.

In every 4-year stretch over the last 10 years, that $1,460 turned into at least $1,900. That’s a 30% gain—at minimum.

Let’s compare that to a traditional savings method:

* A CD (Certificate of Deposit) might earn you around 4.5% per year.
* After 4 years in a CD, you’d have about $1,570.
* That’s only a 7.5% gain.

And remember, that 30% gain was the *worst* outcome in Bitcoin’s 10-year history. The *average* outcome turned that $1,460 into about $6,000. You’d have four times your money.

Sticking with a plan for longer than four years gave you an even greater reward. Here’s how that daily $1 habit worked out over longer time frames:

| Time Frame | Minimum Gain | Average Gain |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 4 Years    | 30%          | 300%          |
| 5 Years    | 48%          | 572%          |
| 6 Years    | 126%         | 1,058%        |
| 7 Years    | 334%         | 839%          |
| 8 Years    | 794%         | 1,365%        |
***Different time frames and their performance with a daily DCA plan***

Remember, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Bitcoin may not do this well in the future, or it could do even better. Either way it’s important to understand its track record and see how powerful it is with the right plan."

Bitcoin could easy go to $5,000,000 per coin.  
It could also go to zero.

Quantum computing poses probably the biggest risk to bitcoin, long term. Yet it seems as though so many on Reddit fail to recognize this threat, because of past performance coupled with their greed and desperation. I strongly believe that there is a relatively short-term window of opportunity during which it's likely to appreciate significantly, which is why I've invested in it, but then, say 5 years out (and this is a VERY broad estimate), it is likely to go to zero, and I believe some other quantum-resistant cryptocurrency will become the new dominant coin. Unless there's an update to the spec. At which point, all the assumptions baked into the current price (such as a permanently limited quantity of coins issued) are subject to change, which could obviously significantly affect the price of bitcoin, literally within minutes.

So all the noise about accumulating ""generational wealth"" via the HODL strategy seems foolish to me. Of course, there are other strategies out there (like trading, but then you need to consider the tax implications). And of course, the noise about ""bitcoin going to zero"" tomorrow seems foolish to me as well, because the true threat to the state of bitcoin is unlikely to appear tomorrow.

So I have to ask, is HODL truly the best strategy?

As always, do your own research, and make informed choices on your own."

Bitcoin, as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, stands in stark contrast to the traditional monetary systems that have long been manipulated by powerful state actors and financial institutions. Bitcoin’s rise presents a solution to systemic issues rooted in the centralization of currency and the manipulation of financial markets. By examining the **game theory** behind Bitcoin and its role in global economics, we can see how Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation challenges the status quo, offering a resilient, decentralized alternative that defies manipulation by geopolitical and financial powers."

I really wish i had discovered Bitcoin back in 2009 or 2010, but unfortunately, I was a teenager back then, busy playing Call of Duty instead of reading whitepapers! 😅

Fast forward to today, I’m seriously considering diving into the world of Bitcoin. After a deep dive into its history and mechanics (I’m a computer science student, by the way), I realized how incredibly genius the whole thing is from the blockchain architecture to the decentralization principles.
I honestly don’t know why I didn’t pay attention to it earlier.

So far, I’ve:

	•	Created an account on Binance

	•	Researched digital wallets and set one up

	•	Planning to get a hardware wallet soon for long-term storage

But here’s the question that keeps nagging me:

Am I too late?

Or is there still room to grow and be part of something bigger?

I'm an undergrad economics student and planning to write my Bachelor's thesis (C-essay) on something related to **Bitcoin**. I’m really interested in how Bitcoin could work as a **reserve currency** and how that might affect things like **sanctions**, **monetary policy**, or **financial sovereignty**.

The tricky part: I need a **measurable research question** with a **clear hypothesis** – ideally something I could test using regression analysis or other quantitative methods.

So I’m turning to you:

>

Some directions I'm already thinking about:

* Bitcoin use in sanctioned countries
* Bitcoin’s impact on capital flows or exchange rates
* Bitcoin adoption and inflation resilience
* Trade behavior under Bitcoin-based transactions

If you have any suggestions – angles, data sources, papers, or problems worth digging into – I’d love to hear them. Thanks a lot!"

📈 Since 2011, Bitcoin’s **average CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)** is around **104.72%**.  
For perspective:

* The **S&P 500** averages about **11–12%** over the past few decades.
* Even **Amazon**, one of the top-performing stocks of all time, has a long-term CAGR around **30%**.

Zoom in:

* **5-year CAGR**: \~45%
* **3-year CAGR**: \~28%
* **1-year CAGR**: \~135%

And no, these aren’t cherry-picked bull runs—these are multi-year averages that include the crashes, bear markets, and FUD storms.

Obviously, past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns. But it’s a solid reminder that Bitcoin isn’t just “volatile”—it’s been one of the **most consistently high-growth assets** of the last decade.

Bitcoin is fundamentally different and it's proving to be pretty resilient during this current market turmoil.  I suppose we will see how this all plays out when the dust settles.

My predictions for this bull run,172,1jzsmib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jzsmib/my_predictions_for_this_bull_run/,171,2025-04-15 09:01:07,"First halving price jump - 9,483% 
Second halving price jump - 2,900% 
Third halving price jump - 693% 

The difference between the first and second is 6,583% 

The difference between second and third is 2,207% 

The difference here is not a simple arithmetic sequence, so we'll need to figure out a little differently. 

So the difference between both prices changes is 4,376% 

We can assume the next price jump is less than 693%, but there is no pattern here, but if we see the value is decreasing at a certain number: 

9483/3.27 = 2,900 

2,900/4.18 = 693 

If we assume a similar ratio 
693/4.18 = 166 
Or if we apply the difference 
4.18 - 3.27 = 0.91 

4.18 + 0.91 = 5.09

693/5.09 = 136.15

We can assume the next halving price surge is either 166% or 136.15%

At the current price of $85,000 
The price surge at 166% = $226,100 
The price surge at 136.15% = 200,727.5

The price peak can be somewhere in between 136% - 166% 

If we calculate the post halving crash after the surge

The first post halving crash was 85% 

Second was 84%

Third was 77%

85 - 84 = 1 
84 - 77 = 7 

The difference 
7-1 = 6 

If we follow that 
7 + 6 = 13 

77-13 = 64% 

The post halving crash could be around 64%

At 136% Price - $200,600

At 166% Price - $226,100

Price crash 64%

200,600 - 64% = $72,216 

226,100 - 64% = $81,396

BTC Tracker dev update! I want to know your opinion :),25,1k03mci,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k03mci,2,2025-04-15 16:28:23,"Hi guys! Since my last post was a warm welcome from you all, I’ve got another update!

As some of you might know from the previous post, I’m developing a **self-hosted, private Bitcoin Tracker**, where you can monitor your purchases, investments, prices, P&L, and more!

Right now, I’m working on integrating some exchanges so that, using their APIs, we can **automatically pull transactions** without needing to manually add them through the admin panel or via CSV import.

For now, I’m focusing **only on FIAT purchases in EUR/USD**.

**Question for you:**  
What are the most popular exchanges you'd want to see supported? Which ones do you use the most?

Currently, on the **dev branch**, I’ve integrated 4 exchanges (obviously chosen because I use them 😄):

* **Strike** – not fully working yet, as they currently lack a historical purchase endpoint.
* **Binance** – works with fiat purchases, spot, and futures.
* **Kraken** – works with Pro (spot and futures purchases).
* **Coinbase** – works with Pro (spot and futures purchases).

Let me know if you’d like to have your favorite exchange integrated!

[https://github.com/wilqq-the/BTC-Tracker](https://github.com/wilqq-the/BTC-Tracker)

Feel free to check out the **dev branch** to test these features!  
  
⚠️ **Reminder:** DEV is for development – expect things to be unstable or not work at all 😅

PS. As some of you guys requested, there's a donate option in a footer with wallet qr, feel free to throw some sats :D"

If the price would drop near that region, I imagine it will cause a bit of a panic in the market since everyone will think he has to sell, while in reality it's only an unrealized loss, and nothing happens as long as he doesn't sell. 

However, I don't fully understand what the mechanics behind that are: I guess he borrowed money to buy this BTC, so it's possible that even if he doesn't want to sell, he basically has to, right (margin call)?

Why Modern Life Feels So Hard (And How Bitcoin Fixes This) with Seb Bunney,9,1jzytqb,https://youtu.be/UTyctm2JyYo,0,2025-04-15 13:11:09,"We all feel it—life seems harder than it should be. Prices keep rising, families are stretched thin, and somehow, despite more productivity and tech than ever before, nobody feels like they’re getting ahead.

This is a thoughtful interview with Seb Bunney who is the author of *The Hidden Cost of Money.*  We unpacked why our broken money keeps making life harder—and why Bitcoin is the exit. We talked fiat incentives, time preference, parenting under monetary stress, and the profound spiritual and human sides of sound money

I've stumbled across bitcoin when it was around 0.22 cents (you read that correct). Back then most people mined from their computer, not a dedicated rig. Never thought it would be where it is today, I felt most countries would view bitcoin as a threat to their currency. Then there were all the hacks, mtgox, missing bitcoins, bitcoins found, etc. and I thought that was it for bitcoin.

Today as I'm looking at geopolitics, the only real choice for financial security is bitcoin. I have traded in and out a few time before (swing trades) but this time I'm a holder, no longer planning on selling, ever. So far only about 20% of my portfolio is in bitcoin however I'm looking to transition to 100% over time.

Just wanted to share my story and apologise for being so wrong about bitcoin over the years. However this community has made me see the light and I'm greatful.

Only 1.3% of world's money is Bitcoin,281,1jzb6lm,https://i.redd.it/i712gu30hvue1.png,35,2025-04-14 16:56:05,"Right now, Bitcoin is sitting at around $84K with a market cap of ~$1.3 trillion — which is just 1.3% of the world's estimated $100 trillion M2 money supply. That number feels tiny when you realize how much buzz Bitcoin generates daily.

But let’s entertain a scenario — what happens if Bitcoin grows to represent just 5% of global money?

That would mean a market cap of $5 trillion.

Simple math:
$5T / 19.7M BTC = ~$253,807 per BTC

That’s roughly a 3x increase from today’s price.

Now think about the implications:

Mainstream Adoption: Governments, banks, and institutions would have to hold Bitcoin. It could become a reserve asset alongside gold.

Reduced Volatility: With more liquidity and adoption, Bitcoin’s wild swings could stabilize.

Policy Disruption: Central banks might lose some grip on monetary control. We’d probably see stronger regulations and faster rollouts of CBDCs.

Psychological Shift: For many, it would mark a turning point — from ""speculative asset"" to ""legitimate money.""


We’re not talking about Bitcoin replacing fiat or hitting 100% of world money — just 5%. And even that would be a monumental shift in the financial landscape."

Here is the conclusion followed by the full response:

Conclusion:

Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset into a strategic macro hedge, a technological infrastructure play, and a financial inclusion tool. In a world where public and private markets blur, and traditional systems strain under the weight of debt and inequality, Bitcoin offers an alternative architecture—resilient, decentralized, and increasingly institutionalized.

A rational investor, reading the tea leaves from these two giants of finance, could conclude:

Bitcoin is no longer a bet against the system. It is a bet on the future system.


Full Response:

Bitcoin Investment Thesis: “Owning the Rails of the New Monetary Infrastructure”

1. The Macro Backdrop: Debt, Inflation, and Geopolitical Instability

Both Fink and Dimon acknowledge profound uncertainty:
	•	Fink highlights a growing mismatch between capital availability and deployment, and notes that government deficits are unsustainable—they can no longer be the primary source of capital.
	•	Dimon warns that sticky inflation, restructuring supply chains, and military investments may force interest rates higher, driving volatility and eroding purchasing power.

Implication: Traditional fiat systems are under strain. Investors will increasingly seek non-sovereign, inflation-resistant assets, and Bitcoin—with its fixed supply and decentralized nature—is a credible contender.

⸻

2. Democratization of Investing + Financial Inclusion
	•	Fink frames investing as a 400-year journey of democratization, calling for greater access to capital markets and asset classes, especially private assets.
	•	Dimon notes that individuals are the ultimate beneficiaries of capital markets, and that financial systems should serve communities directly.

Implication: Bitcoin embodies the ultimate democratization—permissionless access, global participation, and individual sovereignty. As financial inclusion becomes a dominant narrative, Bitcoin offers access to a non-geofenced, 24/7 monetary network.

⸻

3. Private Market Expansion and Infrastructure Capital
	•	Fink champions the shift to private markets as a third leg of the investment stool (50/30/20: stocks, bonds, private assets), especially for financing infrastructure like AI data centers, ports, and energy grids.
	•	Dimon emphasizes new infrastructure demand and supply chain reformation, with significant capital requirements beyond what governments can fund.

Implication: Bitcoin is digital infrastructure—it is not just an asset, but a global monetary protocol. Like railroads or the internet, it represents foundational capital infrastructure for the digital age. Investors who own Bitcoin now are early holders of the next global settlement layer.

⸻

4. Institutionalization and Legitimacy
	•	Fink discusses BlackRock’s move into tokenization, private credit, and real assets, framing it as a frontier for unlocking capital efficiency and access.
	•	Dimon’s JPMorgan already moves over $10 trillion daily and manages $35 trillion in assets, but he’s increasingly cautious about overreliance on traditional instruments.

Implication: With BlackRock leading a spot Bitcoin ETF, and firms like JPMorgan building blockchain-based settlement rails, Bitcoin is being absorbed into the institutional core. The convergence of legacy finance and crypto-native assets like Bitcoin signals structural, long-term adoption.

⸻

5. Optionality Amid Uncertainty

Both leaders advocate resiliency, diversification, and long-term thinking:
	•	Dimon references the importance of fortress balance sheets and optionality in a world of shocks.
	•	Fink suggests moving beyond 60/40 portfolios and rethinking what diversification truly means in today’s market.

Implication: Bitcoin offers non-correlated, asymmetric upside—making it an ideal candidate for a strategic allocation as a hedge against fiat debasement, geopolitical fracture, and systemic fragility.

⸻

Conclusion:

Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset into a strategic macro hedge, a technological infrastructure play, and a financial inclusion tool. In a world where public and private markets blur, and traditional systems strain under the weight of debt and inequality, Bitcoin offers an alternative architecture—resilient, decentralized, and increasingly institutionalized.

Bitcoin is no longer a bet against the system. It is a bet on the future system.

I come to you with the hope to not be part of the club of the ones who lost their bitcoins.

I'm running out of ideas of things to try to recover the addresses they were sent to, so here I come for help. 

Let me explain:

I recently moved my bitcoins to a new wallet using several new addresses from my Coldcard.  
To do so, I used Electrum and Sparrow: one of them to connect to my former wallet and the other to open the addresses and receive the btc to the new wallet (I don't remember which program I used for what).

I did check that the first transfer was working properly and that I could recover the btc with the new wallet before transferring the rest to different other addresses.

Now here comes the problem: when I now copy the public addresses from the Coldcard and open them on either Electrum or Sparrow, I see a different set of addresses.   
I've tried many different account numbers without finding the same addresses that I sent the btc to (they were sent to Segwit addresses).

I checked for malware but none could be found on my Macbook.  
Also, by entering my former wallet, I can still see the addresses the Btc were sent to and can see that they did not move from there, which makes me hope that they were not stolen. 

Do you have any other ideas I could try?"

Bitcoin clicked for me when I stopped thinking of it as an investment,675,1jys57n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jys57n/bitcoin_clicked_for_me_when_i_stopped_thinking_of/,118,2025-04-14 01:18:43,"Most people see Bitcoin as just another risky tech stock—or worse, like buying a lottery ticket. I used to think that way too. But the deeper I dug, the more I realized it's not just about price or profit. It’s really about freedom, math, and time.

Freedom: It's money that doesn't need permission. No central banks, no middlemen—just a system built on rules, not rulers.

Math: For the first time, we have digital scarcity. 21 million coins. Verifiable, auditable, and protected by a decentralized network.

Time: A new block every 10 minutes. Halvings every four years. It’s built to respect time in a way fiat never has.

I’m not trying to pump anything here—I just think a lot of people miss the bigger picture. Bitcoin isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s more like a get-free-slowly path. And the more I learn about money, history, and trustless systems, the more it all clicks.

I want to know how. Is there some formula? I still don't completely understand, because in my head, saying exchanges look at how much people are paying in order to determine the price, when THEY are they ones displaying the price in the first place, doesn't add up to me.

Also, what if I bought a bitcoin for 1 trillion dollars? Is Bitcoin now worth 1 trillion dollars? (yes, obviously for me personally, then, it IS worth 1 trillion. I just don't understand how that would affect what the price would look like for everyone else)"

Hi all,

I’m trying to wrap my head around how crypto taxes work here in the UK. If I trade Bitcoin for USDT (Tether), does that count as a taxable event? I’m not cashing out to GBP, just swapping one crypto for another on an exchange.

Would I need to calculate capital gains based on the value of Bitcoin at the time of the trade in GBP? And if so, how would I determine the value if the trade is crypto-to-crypto?

Also, any tips on how to keep track of all this for tax purposes would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance.

**What is \/r/btc?**

The \/r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin. It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy \/r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.

Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which led to](http://archive.is/0G8az) thousands of redditors being banned from the \/r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc. For a run-down on the history of censorship, please read [A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/bitcoin by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and [/r/Bitcoin Censorship, Revisted by John Blocke](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64). As yet another example, \/r/bitcoin [censored 5,683 posts and comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7414nf/september_2017_stats_post/) just in the month of September 2017 alone. This shows the sheer magnitude of censorship that is happening, which continues to this day. [Read a synopsis of /r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) to get the full story and a complete understanding of [why people are so upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/5gvqf6/and_now_for_something_completely_different_the/) with \/r/bitcoin's censorship. Further reading can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83vgdm/a_collection_of_evidence_regarding_bitcoins/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/cpftea/its_important_to_remember_the_past_and_show/ewp7abj/) with a giant collection of information regarding these topics.

-----

**Why is censorship bad for Bitcoin?**

As demonstrated above, censorship has become prevalent in almost all of the major Bitcoin [communication channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mxov4/wtf_north_koreas_cgc_tries_to_control_bitcoin/dc78hwl/). The [impacts of censorship in Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cxx8t/the_impacts_of_censorship/) are very real. ""Censorship can really hinder a society if it is bad enough. Because media is such a large part of people’s lives today and it is the source of basically all information, if the information is not being given in full or truthfully then the society is left uneducated [...] Censorship is probably the number one way to lower people’s right to freedom of speech."" By censoring certain topics and [specific words](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vr7ij/partial_list_of_words_that_automod_removes_from/), people in these Bitcoin communication channels are literally being brain washed into thinking a certain way, molding the reader in a way that they desire; this has a lasting impact especially on users who are new to Bitcoin. Censoring in Bitcoin is the direct opposite of what the spirit of Bitcoin is, and should be condemned anytime it occurs. Also, it's important to [think critically](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5txje0/edward_snowden_the_answer_to_fake_news_is_not/) and [independently](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/), and have an open mind.

-----

**Why do some groups attempt to discredit \/r/btc?**

This subreddit has become a place to discuss everything Bitcoin-related and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem. Since this subreddit is one of the few places on Reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely, truth is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship. Because of this freedom, people and groups who don't want you to hear the truth with do almost anything they can to try to stop you from speaking the truth and try to manipulate readers here. You can see many cited examples of cases where special interest groups have gone out of their way to attack this subreddit and attempt to disrupt and discredit it. [See the examples here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9cm3nj/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad/)

-----

**What is the goal of \/r/btc?**

This subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin. \/r/btc honors the spirit and nature of Bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about Bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https://modlogs.fyi/r/btc). This subreddit does have [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index#wiki_rules_for_this_subreddit_.28also_in_the_sidebar.29) as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own. Make sure to **[read the /r/btc wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/wiki/index)** for more information and resources about this subreddit which includes information such as the benefits of Bitcoin, how to get started with Bitcoin, and more.

-----

**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is a digital currency, also called a virtual currency, which can be transacted for a low-cost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin also powers the blockchain, which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever. There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper to further understand the schematics of how Bitcoin works.

-----

**What is Bitcoin Cash?**

Bitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is an updated version of Bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing Bitcoin Core (ticker symbol: BTC) for years. Bitcoin (BCH) is just a continuation of the Bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption. You can read more about Bitcoin on [BitcoinCash.org](https://bitcoincash.org/) or read [What is Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoin.com/info/what-is-bitcoin-cash) for additional details.

-----

**How do I buy Bitcoin?**

You can buy Bitcoin on an exchange or with a brokerage. If you're looking to buy, you can [buy Bitcoin with your credit card](https://buy.bitcoin.com/) to get started quickly and safely. There are several others places to buy Bitcoin too; please check the sidebar under brokers, exchanges, and trading for other go-to service providers to begin buying and trading Bitcoin. Make sure to [do your homework first](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-exchange/) before choosing an exchange to ensure you are choosing the right one for you.

-----

**How do I store my Bitcoin securely?**

After the initial step of buying your first Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to secure your Bitcoin. Knowing which Bitcoin wallet to choose is the second most important step in becoming a Bitcoin user. Since you are investing funds into Bitcoin, choosing the right Bitcoin wallet for you is a critical step that shouldn’t be taken lightly. [Use this guide to help you choose the right wallet for you](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-wallet/). Check the sidebar under Bitcoin wallets to get started and find a wallet that you can store your Bitcoin in.

-----

**Why is my transaction taking so long to process?**

Bitcoin transactions typically confirm in ~10 minutes. A confirmation means that the Bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network through the process known as mining. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. Transactions are included in blocks.

If you have sent out a Bitcoin transaction and it’s delayed, chances are the [transaction fee](https://bitcoinfees.cash/) you used wasn’t enough to out-compete others causing it to be [backlogged](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h). The transaction won’t confirm until it clears the backlog. This typically occurs when using the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain due to poor central planning.

If you are using Bitcoin (BCH), you shouldn't encounter these problems as the block limits have been raised to accommodate a massive amount of volume freeing up space and lowering transaction costs.

-----

**Why does my transaction cost so much, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be cheap?**

As described above, transaction fees have spiked on the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain mainly due to a limit on transaction space. This has created what is called a fee market, which has primarily been a premature artificially induced price increase on transaction fees due to the limited amount of block space available (supply vs. demand). The original plan was for fees to help secure the network when the block reward decreased and eventually stopped, but the plan was not to reach that point until some time in the future, [around the year 2140](https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Controlled_supply#Projected_Bitcoins_Long_Term). This original plan was restored with Bitcoin (BCH) where fees are typically less than a single penny per transaction.

-----

**What is the block size limit?**

The original Bitcoin client didn’t have a block size cap, however was limited to 32MB due to the Bitcoin protocol message size constraint. However, in July 2010 Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a [temporary 1MB limit](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/103/tree//trunk/main.h?diff=515630145fcbc978e39dbaa5:102) as an anti-DDoS measure. The temporary measure from Satoshi Nakamoto was made clear three months later when Satoshi said the block size limit can be [increased again by phasing it in](https://archive.is/L5yvP#selection-3315.0-3315.7) when it’s needed (when the demand arises). When introducing Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list in 2008, Satoshi said that [scaling to Visa levels](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) “would probably not seem like a big deal.”

-----

**What is the block size debate all about anyways?**

The block size debate boils down to different sets of users who are trying to come to consensus on the best way to scale Bitcoin for growth and success. Scaling Bitcoin has actually been a topic of discussion since Bitcoin was first released in 2008; for example you can read how Satoshi Nakamoto was [asked about scaling here](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09964.html) and how he thought at the time it would be addressed. Fortunately Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and by the year 2013, scaling Bitcoin had became a hot topic. For a run down on the history of scaling and how we got to where we are today, see the [Block size limit debate history lesson post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61mxuj/block_size_limit_debate_history_lesson/).

-----

**What is a hard fork?**

A hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol. In this case, Bitcoin diverges from a single blockchain to two separate blockchains (a majority chain and a minority chain).

-----

**What is a soft fork?**

A soft fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules, but the difference is that nodes don’t realize the rules have changed, and continue to accept blocks created by the newer nodes. Some argue that [soft forks are bad](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7) because they trick old-unupdated nodes into believing transactions are valid, when they may not actually be valid. This can also be defined as coercion, as [explained by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html).

-----

**Doesn't it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size?**

Some argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space, that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually, giving way to centralization. This is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization; although it has been shown that the [current level of decentralization will remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5fyve1/fallacy_the_key_to_bitcoins_decentralization_is_a/) with or without a block size increase. It's a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes. The reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node (even at 1MB) will be doing it. So whether it's 1MB, 2MB, or 32MB, the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it. If the block size limit is removed, this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators. [Decentralization is not a metric, it's a tool or direction](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/693537120351293440). This is a good video describing the direction of [how decentralization should look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S1IqaSLrq8).

Additionally, the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond 1MB [has been studied](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cornell-study-recommends-4mb-blocksize-bitcoin/) with results showing that up to 4MB is safe and will not hurt decentralization ([Cornell paper, PDF](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf)). Other papers also show that no block size limit is safe ([Peter Rizun, PDF](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/feemarket.pdf)). Lastly, through an informal survey among all top Bitcoin miners, many agreed that a block size increase [between 2-4MB is acceptable](http://archive.is/U3dqr).

Altseason could hit this summer so what does it mean for BTC?,3,1k9ethr,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k9ethr/altseason_could_hit_this_summer_so_what_does_it/,0,2025-04-27 16:19:40,"It feels like every day now, someone’s calling for altseason to hit hard this summer. And the signs are there like smaller caps are waking up, volume’s creeping up on new launches, and the appetite for risk is definitely coming back.

If it really pops off, BTC probably holds steady or grinds up slowly, but the real fireworks would be happening in the lower caps. Same old cycle, Bitcoin builds the base, then money flows down the chain looking for bigger moves. Nothing new, but it feels way faster this time around.

One thing I’m wondering though is that with how quick everything moves now, especially on chains like Solana, is it even realistic to trade without some kind of bot helping you? I’ve seen a lot of people mention BananaGun lately for sniping launches and entries before they slip away. Might honestly be something to look into if things get crazy.

Curious how others are preparing"

According to Broyles, the energy required to mine the final singular Bitcoin will surpass the combined energy it took to mine the first 20,000,000 BTC. He predicts that producing the final Bitcoin could consume energy over the entire first third of the 22nd century.


1.15 million Bitcoin left to mine
Bitcoin’s supply is pegged at 21 million coins. Of the 21 million total Bitcoins, 19.85 million have already been mined, leaving approximately 1.15 million remaining.


Because of Bitcoin’s halving occurrence, it will most certainly take years to mine the remaining coins. The last Bitcoin to be produced and released into circulation is predicted by the end of the year 2140, ensuring that the Bitcoin mining process slows down in the market over time.


After mining is completed, no new Bitcoins will be released into the market. The miners will then use transaction fees to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain.

Bitcoin was trading at $94,181 at the time of writing, having previously reached an all-time high of $109,114 in January."

We all know Bitcoin’s strengths: it’s secure, decentralized, and trusted. But as newer blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and others offer faster speeds and lower fees, some are wondering if Bitcoin is getting left behind.

Sure, it’s the first, and it has a huge community, but should it still be the standard in 2023, or are we just too attached to its history? Could a better solution eventually take its place? Or is Bitcoin’s “first-mover” status enough to keep it ahead of the pack?

What do you think, is Bitcoin still the top dog? "

BTC/XAU = y(t) = 0.015 .

Focusing only on the smoothed long-term average trend (ignoring extreme volatility and cycles), the data best fits an exponential function. Based on rough estimates (using an early 2013 start date and approximate late April 2025 prices), an illustrative model for this average trend is:
y(t) = 0.015 . (1.85)^t

 * y(t) = Estimated average trendline BTC/XAU ratio (oz Gold per BTC)
 * t = Years elapsed since early 2013
 * (b = 1.85 implies an average trend growth factor of ~1.85x per year for this specific period/estimate)

The projected average trendline values for the Bitcoin price in Gold Ounces (oz/BTC) for the next three years are approximately:

•	⁠April 2026 (t = 13.25): 51.5 oz/BTC

•	⁠April 2027 (t = 14.25): 95.2 oz/BTC

•	⁠April 2028 (t = 15.25): 176.1 oz/BTC

--- CRITICAL CAVEATS ---
 * Illustrative Average Trend ONLY: Ignores real volatility/cycles. Actual chart differs drastically.
 * No Predictive Value.
 * NOT Financial Advice.

This model isolates the severely smoothed trend; actual market behavior is dominated by volatility around this average.

A very bitcoin auction... just don't blink.,10,1k6oh1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k6oh1p/a_very_bitcoin_auction_just_dont_blink/,0,2025-04-24 05:02:51,"An auction is a set of rules or procedures to accomplish three things simultaneously. Those things are:

1. Price discovery: determining the fair market price. 
2. Transfer the title of ownership. 
3. Determine the buyer, or who will be paying the seller. 

There's a group of people, the bidders, who know the auction rules to participate to fulfill their economic needs. There can be different rules for different types of things. 

There are FOUR common problems that can result from a typical auction: 

- Buyers not paying, 
- Buyers not picking up,
- Seller not getting paid because buyers didn't pay, 
- And finally, sellers not collecting unsold property. 

But since Bitcoin Cash has a very capable scripting system, we could have a perfect auction that accomplished the three functions needed and prevented the four property/payment problems perfectly. 

With CashTokens, what we need is one transaction that remits payment to the seller, and releases the token for the buyer, while allowing anyone to bid at any price. 

Auctions take time. Bidders need to know that something will be sold, & about when. Bidders need to research authenticity, the current market and plan their overall strategy.  

In a Dutch Auction, a successively lower ASK is called until someone bids. The first and only bidder wins the lot. 

A Dutch auction may sometimes transition into an English auction. In an English auction, the ASK goes up in regular increments with successive bids from different parties until no one wants to bid higher and an auctioneer says ""sold"". 

So to do an English auction in bitcoin, we'd need to keep track the current high bidder, their bid and (since we can't put that info on the NFT being sold), we'd need some way to link or refer a bid to the token utxo. 

In a bitcoin virtual machine, there is no global state like with an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). While it's possible to write an [English-like auction system](https://github.com/BitCANN/contracts/blob/main/README.md) with CashTokens, a Dutch auction is much more straight-forward because it can be done in one transaction with no need to keep track of the bid, bidder, or link to the lot being sold. 

Again, the rules for a Dutch Auction are:

- Start at some very high price.
- Go down in regular increments.
- The first bid wins. 

Dutch auctions are great at getting things sold―they're great for throughput. 

If we use the same ridiculous price (maybe 50 BCH) for every lot, then the only state we need to keep track of is time, which is already available on every bitcoin output since 2017. 

So what do we need to say in bitcoin to make this auction happen? What does the auction contract need to check? 

- An output MUST be a version 2 transaction (for timelocks).
- The output value MUST must be higher than the ASK. 
- An output MUST pay the seller the current ASK. 
- If using block height as time, we need some checks for that.

We don't care where the buyer sends their new token, that's unrestricted, or restricted by consensus rules already. 

To list tokens for sale, a seller could send their tokens to a contract where the ASK is always 50 BCH divided by the age of the unspent output in blocks, and anyone would be able to create a transaction spending their tokens and paying the seller the fair market price for their token.  

The above logic in CashScript (// BitcoinScript): 

    contract DutchAuction(

      // Opening ASK 
      int open,

      // LockingBytecode of the consigner, the address receiving payout
      bytes recipientLockingBytecode

    ) {

      // 
      function buy() {
           
        // Require version 2 for BIP68 support
        // OP_TXVERSION OP_2 OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY 
        require(tx.version == 2, ""must use v2 transaction""); 

        // The minimum relative age is the opening bid divided by the ask.
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTVALUE OP_DIV 
        int requiredAge = open/tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].value;

        // The age in blocks must be in a valid BIP68 range
        // ffff00 OP_OVER OP_GREATERTHAN OP_VERIFY 
        require(65535 > requiredAge, ""open over value (required age) must be less than 65535"");   

        // Enforce the minimum age. 
        // OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP 
        require(this.age >= requiredAge, ""bid too low"");

        // Check that each output sends to the consignor
        // OP_INPUTINDEX OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE OP_EQUAL
        require(tx.outputs[this.activeInputIndex].lockingBytecode == recipientLockingBytecode, ""must payout consigner"");
        
      } 

    }

The above code works out to 26 bytes for the auction logic on the blockchain. 

It looks like this:

    c2529c69007ac0cc9603ffff005179a069007ab275c0cd517a87

With the balance of the auction contract, showing the age of the lots, no special service is needed to calculate the ASK. It's decentralized, use your own computer.

After 1 block the ASK is 50 BCH. After 10 blocks the ASK would be 5 BCH. After a week (~1000 blocks) the price would be 0.05. After a month the price would be 1.25M sats. After a year the price would be 76k sats, which would be about as low as it goes. 

There's a lot of stuff left out: 

- no commission
- no premiums 
- no auctioneers
- no volley of bidders
- no cancellations 
- no welching
- no unsold property (of value above 76k sats) 

Bidders would have to pay standard transaction fees to miners. 

But sellers don't get a free ride. Sellers that no longer wished to auction their property could cancel by buying their lots back. They pay by expressing what price they believe is too low, just like everyone else. They'd have to pay themselves the current ASK, and pay miners a fee for doing so. 

It would be easy for a seller to list 10 NFTs (or 1000) using a single contract address. The seller's auction contract is just a token-aware bitcoin cash address. They could send tokens to it from any wallet with support for sending to such a CashToken aware address. 

The auction contract is designed for arbitrage. A transaction could be built simultaneously buying purchasing a fungible token at auction while swapping the same token out for Bitcoin Cash on a compatible dex like cauldron. 

The parameters to find an auction contract on-chain are just the start price and the seller's address. That data would fit in an the size of NFT commitment. So sellers could announce that they were having an auction, [if/when we had a CashToken powered social dapp for that.](https://fundme.cash/campaign/28)

***

EDIT:

The auction contract requires that each output pay for a lot on a corresponding input, so many lots (of the same age) could be purchased simultaneously in a single transaction. An app could include a function to close the auction by buying every lot in a single transaction."

Bond Market Blues,0,1k6ky0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k6ky0o/bond_market_blues/,1,2025-04-24 00:53:33,"I. The Starting Point: Cracks in the Old System

We’re already here.
	•	Sovereign debt is unpayable: U.S., Japan, EU, China—all buried in debt with no path to repayment.
	•	Central banks are trapped: Raise rates? Trigger defaults. Cut rates? Fuel inflation.
	•	Trust is eroding: Bond yields rise, currencies wobble, and capital starts fleeing “safe” assets.

Key stress point: The bond market begins to smell smoke. Foreign buyers (like China or Japan) stop buying Treasuries. The Fed quietly becomes the buyer of last resort again.

⸻

II. The Liquidity Trap Meets Fiscal Dominance
	•	Rates rise, and the cost of debt explodes. U.S. interest payments hit $1.5 trillion/year.
	•	Treasury auctions begin to fail. Investors demand higher yields to roll debt.
	•	The Fed is forced into stealth yield curve control—buying longer-term debt to suppress rates.

This is the moment the mask slips.
Markets realize: the Fed is no longer targeting inflation. It’s targeting solvency.

⸻

III. Inflation Reignites, Faith Breaks
	•	Suppressed yields and unchecked spending light a second wave of inflation.
	•	Savers are slaughtered by negative real rates.
	•	Financial repression begins: capital controls, mandatory bond purchases, limits on cash or crypto use.

But capital is fluid, and trust is faster than law. Money leaks out—into gold, hard assets, offshore accounts—and increasingly, Bitcoin.

⸻

IV. The Flippening (of Trust)

This is not a technological shift. It’s a trust migration.
	•	Nation-states lose the narrative. “Risk-free” becomes a joke.
	•	Bitcoin is no longer seen as speculative—it’s seen as a hedge against sovereign failure.
	•	Nations with weak currencies begin to adopt Bitcoin openly (already happening with El Salvador).
	•	Corporates start holding it on balance sheets—not to get rich, but to survive devaluation.

Some early governments fight it—banning self-custody, labeling it dangerous, taxing it to death. Others embrace it—gaining early access to the next financial layer.

⸻

V. The New Market Infrastructure Emerges

As trust deepens:
	•	Bitcoin lending markets mature: Lenders issue loans backed by overcollateralized BTC.
	•	Bitcoin-denominated bonds are issued—either directly (El Salvador-style), or via DeFi protocols.
	•	Sovereigns who can’t borrow in fiat anymore start to float Bitcoin-backed debt—just to get access to real capital.
	•	Layer 2 systems (Lightning, Fedimint, Ark, etc.) enable payment rails and banking functions.

A new monetary ecosystem grows—parallel to the old one—but faster, smaller, and harder.

⸻

VI. The Collapse Phase of the Old Guard

Eventually, the debt burden breaks the fiat system:
	•	Central banks lose control of inflation and can no longer contain bond yields.
	•	A default or restructuring hits a major economy (Japan? Italy? U.S.?)
	•	The dollar survives—but not as king. A multi-polar system forms: USD, CNY, and BTC.

In this world:
	•	Bitcoin is the reserve of last resort.
	•	Fiat is still used, but it’s anchored, not absolute.
	•	Credit exists, but it’s hard-won, expensive, and honest.

⸻

VII. Life After the Transition: Scarcity Reinstated
	•	Governments shrink. They can no longer print to fund endless wars, bloated bureaucracies, or financial bailouts.
	•	Savings are meaningful. Time preference drops. Capital investment improves.
	•	Credit is available, but collateralized and market-priced.
	•	The financial system becomes more stable, but less forgiving.

And Bitcoin?
It isn’t a replacement for government. It’s a neutral monetary foundation—like gravity. Everyone must build on top of it honestly, or fail.

⸻

Final Image:

Picture a future where:
	•	Treasury bonds are relics.
	•	Bitcoin yields set the global floor for risk-free return.
	•	Countries are rated by how credibly they can borrow real money.
	•	And the market, not the central bank, holds the true power."

He simply shared what he did and what came out of it.

What caught my attention was that he wasn’t trying to impress anyone or push something. It felt genuine — calm and to the point.

I decided to try out one of the ideas he mentioned. Didn't expect much, just did it out of curiosity. And strangely enough, it actually had an effect. After that, I started looking at a few things differently — things I had previously ignored.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1h0nwvh/btcers_owning_coins_proportion_of_selfcustody_vs/

The numbers who hold their own keys / coins self-custodially is strictly larger than the number of people who run nodes.

Why is that?

Because you can hold your keys/coins without even running a node. You can use a light wallet (SPV), or even just hold your own bitcoin on a paper wallet (written record of the key / seed phrase).

So there are even fewer than 15% who run their own nodes. Likely way fewer.

Just bear this in mind when you hear BTC people talk about how everyone should be running their own node etc.

That's bunk, and has almost always been bunk. Satoshi didn't design the system in a way that requires everyone to their own node. The BTC crowd doesn't do this either. The people claiming you need to, belong to a very small part of the user group.

Where things can get off track is when you let the proclaimed needs of a very small minority dictate the properties of the system that is supposed to be usable by all its users. The best check on preventing the majority being exploited by the minority, is for the majority to check, frequently, whether the system still performs well for their purposes.

Theoretically, if it was currency, this would be happening daily, en masse."

"Western BCH Withdrawals, Eastern Exchange BCH Deposits: What's Happening? Self-Custody Gains Traction, Binance Attracts Leveraged Whales.",10,1k2gagc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1k2gagc/western_bch_withdrawals_eastern_exchange_bch/,1,2025-04-18 16:34:20,"Recent trends in the cryptocurrency market reveal intriguing shifts in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) activity. Over the past two years, data suggests a growing inclination among users on Western exchanges like Coinbase to withdraw their BCH holdings, likely indicating a move towards self-custody. This observation aligns with a significant surge in hardware wallet purchases across various brands, further supporting the notion of users prioritizing direct control over their digital assets. Bitcoin Cash, known for its fast and low-cost transactions, facilitates this self-custody trend seamlessly.

Concurrently, a contrasting pattern has emerged on platforms such as Binance. Unlike previous behavior where traders primarily used Bitcoin (BTC) or Tether (USDT) as collateral for BCH leveraged futures, substantial BCH deposits, reaching into the hundreds of thousands, have been observed. This novel trend suggests that large-scale leverage traders, often referred to as ""whales,"" are now utilizing BCH itself to back their positions.

This shift could potentially be linked to the recent endeavors by major exchanges like OKX and Binance to expand their services into the United States. As these platforms navigate regulatory landscapes, they may be prompting users to transition away from naked trading positions and instead deposit actual cryptocurrency to collateralize their trades. This would explain the observed increase in BCH deposits on Binance, representing a move towards more in kind crypto backed positions.

Edit:

Further anecdotal evidence highlights this divergence. On April 12th and 14th, the price of BCH on the spot exchange Coinbase briefly surpassed $380. In stark contrast, Binance, a platform offering leveraged trading, saw BCH peak at only $358 on the 12th. This discrepancy potentially arises from the fundamental differences between spot and leverage exchanges. Coinbase, as a spot market, requires actual BCH to facilitate trades, limiting downward price pressure if supply is constrained. Conversely, Binance allows traders to short-sell significant amounts of BCH without holding the underlying asset, potentially creating abundant, albeit synthetic, liquidity that can suppress price, even if the exchange's actual BCH reserves are limited."

However, I noticed that BCH is regaining it's upward momentum so it's time to bring these play dollars back home again to the best blockchain in the world. BCH.

I ironically started here, in 2017. It was the first crypto I bought, at the pico top of 4000$ when it came onto Coinbase. Here I began my journey into decentralization, learned about the truth of the money system, got introduced to the coolest most based community in crypto - and here I vowed no matter where I played I would always return value back into BCH.

Now is the time, my shift back will be epic. From different chains. From my job, spare dollars. 

I'm not a BCH maxi, but I will hold a significant portion of my wealth in BCH.

From everywhere it will slowly trickle back into BCH.

And then I will simply wait. 

For the inevitable proof that peer to peer cash will outdo everything else.

I don’t normally do this, and it’s honestly hard to even type this out—but I’m in a really rough spot right now. Life’s thrown me more curveballs than I can handle lately, and I’m just trying to keep my head above water.

I've been doing everything I can to stay strong, to keep pushing, to not let it break me… but right now I’m drained—mentally, emotionally, and financially. I’m not looking for pity or handouts. Just some support. Even a kind word goes a long way right now. But if anyone is in a position to help, even just a little, it would mean the world to me.

This isn't easy to admit, but I believe in community, and I believe that sometimes it’s okay to reach out when you need a hand.

Thanks for reading. Seriously.

🧠 TL;DR
20.44 ETH was stolen in a targeted hack. Funds were traced through Ethereum & ArbitrumFinal destination: a wallet on MEXC Exchange. MEXC confirmed the ETH arrived & froze the account. Slovenian police submitted a legal return request through MEXC's official LEROS portal. MEXC received an officially translated court order. Still REFUSED to return the ETH. 
Let that sink in: even when the crime is proven and the courts are involved, the stolen funds stay locked — but not returned.

🔍 The Trace
Using public on-chain data:
5 ETH withdrawals from Bitstamp (totaling 20.44 ETH)Passed through mixers and multiple wallets. Bridged from Ethereum → Arbitrum using Stargate. Final deposit: ~4.7 ETH lands in MEXC wallet 0x9b64...77E5You can literally follow it step-by-step on Etherscan and Arbiscan. The evidence is bulletproof.

🤔 Why This Should Worry You
MEXC is an offshore exchange (Seychelles-based), so it's outside the reach of many global consumer protection laws. But here’s the kicker:
""We’ll freeze a criminal’s account… but we’ll keep the stolen funds.""If that becomes the norm, no wallet is safe. The question is no longer whether exchanges can trace and block stolen crypto — it’s whether they’ll ever give it back.

📢 Why We Need to Talk About This
This isn’t just about one user or one case. It’s about:
Holding centralized exchanges accountableProtecting users from becoming victims of regulatory loopholesDemanding that platforms honor legal systems, not just freeze funds and walk awayIf one of the world’s biggest exchanges can ignore police channels and court orders, what hope is there for the average crypto investor?

👊 Let’s Take Action
Avoid MEXC until they release a transparent stolen asset policySpread the word — Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, DiscordTag @MEXC_Official and demand accountabilitySupport crypto journalism that exposes bad actorsShare your own stories — let’s make noiseWe’ve seen great things happen when this community pulls together. Let’s not allow this to be swept under the rug.

I had my BTC stored in my wallet with NEXO.

  
I sent my BTC to my Nexo BTC wallet address and did not receive the funds.

  
I was told they had changed my BTC wallet address and it is no longer an active address and they cannot retrieve my BTC.

  
I checked yesterday and there are multiple transactions in that wallet.

  
I know this has happened to multiple people and Nexo refuse to return the crypto.

  
However you can see the wallet is very much active and still is, so they lied.

  
Any ideas to get my BTC back, it was a fair amount to lose (for me anyway).

Let's talk about block time for 1001st time,21,1jzomlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jzomlh/lets_talk_about_block_time_for_1001st_time/,45,2025-04-15 05:39:35,"I believe we can safely have 1-minute block time WITHOUT sacrificing anything in scalability / decentralization - because tech has advanced so much since 2009. Even worst-case orphan rate would be under 2% (case of full block download), and thanks to compact blocks typical rates would be in 0.2%-0.6% range ([full analysis](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md#mining-centralization)).

Not only that, but we can do a [little refactoring](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md#blockchain-height-abstraction) so it would be easy to later change to 30s when tech further advances - we could make target block time just 1 parameter like blocksize limit, with everything auto-adjusting around it (DAA, emission, ABLA, locktime, etc.)

### What about emission?

Of course everything stays the same, before: 3.25 BCH x 1 block every 10 minutes, after: 0.325 BCH x 10 every 10 minutes.
Due to integer rounding there'd be [slightly less BCH minted in total](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md?ref_type=heads#block-subsidy-shortfall): 20,999,999.7270 instead of 20,999,999.9769.

### What would this change mean for UX?

- 1-conf: now 1-in-4 TXs will wait 14 min. or more, and 1-in-20 will wait 30 min. or more; with 1-min target the variance band is reduced to 1-3 min. I even made a little game where you can test your confirmation luck ([link](https://fablous-18ff29.gitlab.io/)) and get a feel for the difference.
- N-conf: now a 60min target wait (6x10) will exceed 80 min. 1-in-5 times. With faster blocks a 60min target wait (60x1) would get more reliably closer to 60min, with only 0.86% chance of exceeding 80min

### What about 0-conf?

It's great, we continue to use it. This [will make on-boarding easier](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md?ref_type=heads#potential-0-conf-adoption-benefits) as it will shorten the uncertainty window, and there are cases where 0-conf must fall back to 1-conf which would benefit from this (like when moving from 0-conf defi to 0-conf merchant payments - the p2sh unconfirmed ancestors create risks here)

### What about header chain overheads?

- Nodes will always need whole header chain, and it will grow at ~42MB/year, trivial at current state of tech
- Light clients need those for verifying SPV proofs but thankfully there's [a way to compact that data for light clients](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md#spv-client-storage-requirements)

### What about locktime?

This was one of my concerns too, turns out this is the [easiest technical challenge to solve](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous/-/blob/master/readme.md?ref_type=heads#transaction-locktime-and-input-sequence).

**There is no technical obstacle to having 1-minute block time. The only question is: do we want it?**

###  But Bitcoin always had 10-minute time, will we still be Bitcoin?

Of course we will. Ask yourself, what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin?

From the WP:

>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

The 10-minute time was a number Satoshi picked and didn't think too much about, I found that his concerns were only of practical nature. I discuss that head-on in the CHIP's Intro:

In Bitcoin whitepaper ([Section 7. Reclaiming Disk Space](https://github.com/ibz/bitcoin-whitepaper-markdown/blob/master/bitcoin-whitepaper.md#7-reclaiming-disk-space)), it was only mentioned once, when discussing node memory requirements:

>A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

When paper was first revealed on Cryptography Mailing List, it was also mentioned only once, alongside with explanation of Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA):

>> Further, your description of events implies restrictions
>> on timing and coin generation - that the entire network
>> generates coins slowly compared to the time required for
>> news of a new coin to flood the network
>
>Sorry if I didn't make that clear. The target time between blocks will probably be 10 minutes.
>
>Every block includes its creation time. If the time is off by more than 36 hours, other nodes won't work on it. If the timespan over the last 6*24*30 blocks is less than 15 days, blocks are being generated too fast and the proof-of-work difficulty doubles. Everyone does the same calculation with the same chain data, so they all get the same result at the same link in the chain.

Only later, in [e-mail exchange with Mike Hearn](https://www.bitcoin.com/satoshi-archive/emails/mike-hearn/9/#selection-25.3372-25.4009), did Satoshi give a hint about reasoning, to describe what we now call orphan races and selfish mining:

>>Another is the 10 minute block target. I understand this was chosen to
>>allow transactions to propagate through the network. However existing
>>large P2P networks like BGP can propagate new data worldwide in <1
>>minute.
>
>If propagation is 1 minute, then 10 minutes was a good guess.  Then nodes are only losing 10% of their work (1 minute/10 minutes).  If the CPU time wasted by latency was a more significant share, there may be weaknesses I haven't thought of.  An attacker would not be affected by latency, since he's chaining his own blocks, so he would have an advantage.  The chain would temporarily fork more often due to latency.

Since then, technology has progressed immensely and a thriving industry of Bitcoin competitors (""altcoins"", near-universally preferring lower block times) has emerged demonstrating viability of shorter block times.
Bitcoin Cash can now follow suit, leveraging today's tech to rethink that 10-minute legacy.

We will lean on the same reasoning as Satoshi's, and use a more conservative orphan rate threshold (2%), to show that Bitcoin Cash can safely upgrade to 1-minute target block time and reap 10x improvement in confirmation speed."

Satoshi stared out the window, his reflection fractured by raindrops. Beside him, Eva slept fitfully, one hand resting over her stomach, dark circles under her eyes betraying sleepless nights of shared anguish.

A commotion erupted several seats ahead. Two teenage boys argued with the ticket checker, their voices rising in desperation.

""Please, sir, we just need to get to Palo Alto—""

""No ticket, no ride,"" the checker interrupted, his voice firm but weary. ""Rules are rules.""

Satoshi watched as the boys were escorted off at the next station, their figures growing smaller through the rain-streaked window. The train lurched forward again, each car following the one before it in an unbroken chain.

Chain.

The word lodged in his mind as he stared at the coupling mechanism between the cars. Each car validated the one behind it, connected in an unbreakable sequence. His heart began to race. With trembling hands, he pulled a napkin from his pocket, his pen scratching out rough diagrams. Blocks. Each one linked to the previous one. A chain of digital truth that couldn't be broken.

This ideological consistency could appeal to a niche group of users and investors who prioritize PoW's perceived security and decentralization characteristics over alternatives like Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

 * Merged Mining Potential: The shared SHA-256 algorithm allows for merged mining. This means Bitcoin miners could potentially mine iceEVcoin simultaneously without significant additional hardware or energy costs, earning supplementary income (especially relevant as Bitcoin's own block subsidies decrease over time). For iceEVcoin, this offers a path to leverage Bitcoin's established network security.

 * Extreme Scarcity Appeal: The proposed 7 million supply cap represents extreme digital scarcity, even more so than Bitcoin. This could attract a niche market segment that specifically values absolute rarity as a primary characteristic of a store-of-value asset.

 * Reinforcing the PoW Narrative: In the ongoing debate between PoW and PoS, the existence of a secondary, Bitcoin-aligned PoW chain like iceEVcoin could serve to highlight PoW's perceived advantages (like permissionless participation). It adds to the diversity of the PoW ecosystem, potentially showcasing its resilience and reinforcing the narrative against PoS alternatives, which might be viewed with more suspicion regarding centralization or state influence in a Bitcoin-centric future.

 * Anti-Centralization Narrative: While the feasibility was questioned in the reports, the proposed mobile EV mining concept taps into concerns about mining centralization. This narrative, focused on distributing hash power, could appeal to users specifically concerned about potential government influence over large, stationary mining operations.

Long story short, in 2022 Silvergate was accused of allowing billions in customer funds to flow from FTX to Alameda, raising serious compliance concerns. Several reports, including the ones from The Bear Cave and Reuters, revealed some concerns over the company’s policies to monitor suspicious activities within the SEN network. 



At the same time, the DOJ launched a fraud probe into Silvergate’s links with FTX. And soon, the company announced it would shut down its SEN Network and delay its 10-K filing.



With all these situations piling up, $SI plunged more than 90%, and investors filed a lawsuit against the company.



The good news is that Silvergate finally agreed to settle over this. The details are yet to be finalized. But if you invested back then you can already file a claim to [get some payment. ](https://11th.com/cases/silvergatecapital-investor-settlement)

Bitcoin is moss.,20,1jy05hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jy05hf/bitcoin_is_moss/,20,2025-04-13 00:06:10,"Bitcoin Is Moss

Body:
Bitcoin isn’t a revolution in the traditional sense. It doesn’t shout. It doesn’t demand. It doesn’t storm the gates.

It spreads.

Like moss.

It moves quietly. It doesn’t need headlines or permission. It simply finds surfaces—old stone, decaying wood, forgotten cracks in foundations—and begins to grow. Slowly. Persistently. Irreversibly.

Fiat systems are the stone.
They appear solid: institutions, currencies, central banks. But over time, they weather. They crack. Their weight becomes their weakness. And once those cracks appear, Bitcoin enters.

It doesn’t attack the structure. It covers it. It renders it obsolete not by confrontation, but by quiet redundancy. It’s not about destruction. It’s about persistence.

You can’t uproot moss—it has no central stalk.
You can’t kill it by cutting—it grows from fragments.
You can’t burn it away—it thrives in the shade and returns with the rain.

Bitcoin is the same.
There’s no CEO to arrest.
No headquarters to raid.
No switch to flip.
It’s a distributed organism. A living network of memory and value.
Every attempt to contain it only spreads its awareness.

And like moss, it thrives in neglected places—where trust has eroded, where inflation eats value, where systems are collapsing under their own weight.

The more centralized control tries to reassert itself, the more obvious the need for something else becomes.
Bitcoin doesn’t replace fiat by force. It makes it irrelevant.
Not through revolution, but through saturation.

You don’t notice moss at first.
Then one day, the statue is covered.
The wall is green.
The monument to the old world is now a part of the forest floor.

That’s Bitcoin.

Not a war.
A reclamation.

Bitcoin is still, hands down, the safest long-term investment in the entire crypto space. It’s the most decentralized, most secure, and most adopted, and yet every single day I see people complaining about the dip like it’s the end of the world.

You should be *happy* when BTC dips. It’s like Black Friday for the only digital asset with a fixed supply and proven resilience. You *know* it’ll bounce back eventually, it always does. We’ve seen this cycle repeat itself for years. Zoom out, look at the bigger picture.

Why are people still acting like this is some random altcoin with zero fundamentals?"
Why 30-min block time is better than 10-min block time,0,1jyhl89,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jyhl89/why_30min_block_time_is_better_than_10min_block/,24,2025-04-13 15:45:30,"If you understand how PoW works, you know why SN decided that block time is 10 mins and not 5 mins. When we have too many miners that speed up the bitcoin clock, difficulty adjustment slows it down so the nodes can have consensus. The slower the block time, the less likely the event that 2 valid blocks are found at the same time where we have to measure the chain tip weight to decide the winning chain tip. The losing chain tip wastes a lot of energy.

""The payee needs proof that at the time of each trans­ac­tion, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. […] When there are multiple double-spent versions of the same trans­ac­tion, one and only one will become valid. The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that it’s valid. The network will resolve any possible double-spend races by then."" - SN (2009)

Based on the SN's quote above, we should have decided that the block time is 1 hour. However, that might be too slow for some applications, so 30 mins seem better.

I have proposed a slower version of Bitcoin, its whitepaper can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iceEVcoin/s/DXsdJbBEV0

How BTC will be inflated on L2s and bailouts will continue even on Bitcoin standard.,27,1jx9uhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jx9uhy/how_btc_will_be_inflated_on_l2s_and_bailouts_will/,21,2025-04-12 00:11:57,"I'll tell you how inflation and bailouts will eventually happen even on a bitcoin standard.

It'll start with tx fees gng through the roof as banks, govts and big businesses start settling onchain.
All normies will have to deposit their btc in the banks, as all small utxo  (ie. 99% of population's stash) will become dust utxo, and self custody on L1 will become a luxury only top 0.0001% could afford. 

All normies now transact on L2's where banks provide their IoU's. Initially banks will happily provide proof of reserves to lure you in and make you trust them, but eventually they'll stop doing so, as they start inflating the IoU's.
At one point, the IoU's floating around will be too much and ppl will start questioning the banks, but even then what could one do, since you can't self custody on L1 due to high tx fees.

Even if ppl start withdrawing from banks somehow, the banks will stop  withdrawals pretty quickly and central banks / govts instead of taking action on the banks for inflating the IoU's, will simply make fractional reserve legal for BTC too.
So now for each 1 BTC, banks would be allowed to issue 10 BTC IoU's on L2, that too legally (which they would already be doing for a long time, and even after getting caught it will just become a legal practice instead)

Welcome back to Gold 2.0 system, where Fiat was the L2 for gold, and we all know how. that turned out.

But somehow ppl continue to believe there'll be no bailouts, censorship, draconian level surveillance and taxation on L2. 

Only real solution is some p2p cash with low fee L1 tx's with relatively quick tx confirmations. 

BCH works great as a p2p ecash system on L1, but its limited supply and trending to zero block subsidy is a major risk, as it puts a time limit on the adoption picking up. 
If the adoption / tx volume doesn't pick before the block subsidy runs out, BCH will be dead too. 

I think some pre-determined linear inflation is a good thing in the long term, as it replaces lost coins and more importantly prevents hoarding mentality. 
It also doesn't put a hard time limit on the adoption, which will clearly take a long time, given how brainwashed general public is about BTC. "

Saylor was wrong. 2nd best is here.,0,1jxwxiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jxwxiq/saylor_was_wrong_2nd_best_is_here/,56,2025-04-12 20:50:54,"Historically, among the metallic money group, Silver is the 2nd best compared to Gold. Some people simply prefer Silver's color.

Among the blockchain money group, the 2nd best is really similar to Bitcoin, except it has slower block time (30 mins), and lower supply cap (7 million coins). All other parameters remain the same as Bitcoin.

Since PoW consumes a lot of energy but most people only use it as store of value, it is more logical to slow the block time down to 30 mins (vs Bitcoin's 10 mins). You don't put your Gold into storage and immediately take your Gold out 10 mins later. Even when you charge your electric cars, it will take at least 30 mins to get any meaningful energy.

The lower supply cap is obviously to minimalize the ""inflation"" caused by this inevitable hard fork.

The whitepaper of this hard fork was shared to r/btc yesterday. I also shared it to r/Bitcoin today, as I needed time to find the right words to share it there, where a lot of Bitcoin maxis are. Still, the moderators there did not allow this to be posted.

Please don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin and Bitcoin is still the best. However, this ""2nd best"" is inevitable, since careless people are everywhere and most lost coins cannot be easily recovered. As the number of lost coins rises, at some point we might not have enough coins to address the salability across scales.

Lastly, I want to note that this is still just a whitepaper written by my friend Frost Aiken (a developer who prefers to remain pseudonymous). I am having trouble contacting Frost but will try again later. When and how this whitepaper can become an actual hard fork will depend on many factors and only time will tell. God bless and a good weekend y'all.

Thank You,

My 1st move,0,1jxencw,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jxencw/my_1st_move/,4,2025-04-12 05:55:07,"About 10 months ago, I started closely following global news and political events. I had this gut feeling that something big was going to hit the market, especially with how governments and central banks were moving.

So back in June last year, I began buying Bitcoin in portions, gradually building up to a total of 5 BTC by the end of November—when the price was around $37,000. I held on, trusting my read of the global situation, and when Bitcoin hit $100,000, I sold everything.

This was actually my first real experience with this kind of investment—and it paid off big time.
But for me, it wasn’t just about being patient. It was about staying aware and reading between the lines of what’s happening in the world.

Has anyone else been through something similar? Do you think political analysis is always this powerful in timing big market moves?

Not trusting themselves to understand it, they ignore it, believe what existing financial authorities tell them about it (often a rather biased story since 2009) and rather play the lottery (stonks, ponzi ""coins"" ... incl. BTC these days).

It's a shame. It really seems people need a shock (or a hugely visible, like nation level, example of how peer to peer cash adoption can succeed).

I don't think any form of speculation is the ""killer app"" for bringing Bitcoin awareness to the masses.

It's mildly encouraging that a lot of people now recognize the threat of inflation and the difficulty of saving for old age, and some of them may re-examine what is wrong with our financial systems and whether it's a problem inherent in the facile money printing of fiat (debt money)."
"Whitepaper: iceEVcoin - Proposal for Minimalist Bitcoin Variant (7M Cap, 30m PoW Blocks) - Seeking Developer Feedback & Collaboration",0,1jwm4yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jwm4yd/whitepaper_iceevcoin_proposal_for_minimalist/,4,2025-04-11 04:56:58,"Hello r/btc community,

I'm Bubbly_Ice3836. I'm sharing a whitepaper today written by 'Frost Aiken', a developer who prefers to remain pseudonymous.

This paper outlines iceEVcoin, conceived as an experimental, minimalist variant of the Bitcoin protocol. It stems from a deep respect for Bitcoin's core principles (Proof-of-Work, UTXO model) but explores the potential impact of just two specific parameter changes:

 * Maximum Supply: Fixed at 7 million coins (exploring extreme scarcity).

 * Target Block Interval: Set to 30 minutes (exploring potential effects on network energy profile and niche settlement times, like EV charging).

The full rationale and technical specification details are in the whitepaper linked below. The intention is strict adherence to Bitcoin's design in all other functional aspects.

Whitepaper is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iceEVcoin/s/DimWJTLigi

Current Status & Call for Collaboration:

To be fully transparent: The source code implementing these changes is not yet developed. Frost Aiken conceptualized the variant and authored the paper, but due to resource constraints, implementation hasn't begun.

This whitepaper is being shared specifically to gauge interest within communities familiar with Bitcoin forks/variants and to seek potential C++ developers knowledgeable about the Bitcoin Core codebase who might find this specific exploration intriguing and be interested in collaborating on its implementation (code, testnet, etc.).

Acknowledged Trade-offs:
The 30-minute block time is a major design choice with a significant impact on transaction speed, making it unsuitable for many applications. This is understood and is part of the specific trade-off being explored, as detailed in the paper.

Project Ethos:
There is no pre-mine, ICO, or founder's reward envisioned. The intent is a fair launch mirroring Bitcoin's principles, should the project proceed to implementation.

Contact:
Developers interested in discussing the technical aspects further or potentially collaborating can reach out to me (Bubbly_Ice3836) via Reddit PM initially. We welcome constructive technical feedback and discussion on the merits and challenges of this proposed variant."

But this has blinded me from looking at what bitcoin could be if it didn't have these issues, and I do see that a decentralized, hard capped, and easily transportable asset might have value. I do not know if you can ever get this without it developing into what bitcoin has become though. It could be that bitcoin's path was inevitable. I do wonder if maybe one day someone will figure out a way to make a coin that doesn't have these issues."

My one friend who hold a fair amount of crypto thinks it's a good thing, but as someone who first learned about BTC around its security and anonymity value, it would seem that for some people, it would be less valuable if the Federal Government had its own Bitcoin mining and administrative tools and oversight influence.

vox.cash - A collection of integrated Bitcoin Cash mini apps. | fundme.cash campaign #28:,10,1jtnkck,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jtnkck/voxcash_a_collection_of_integrated_bitcoin_cash/,0,2025-04-07 10:09:12,"Yesterday I started a fundme for a collection of small BCH web apps in an integrated wallet. Collectively, the hope is, if a number of ""safe"" ideas are integrated into a wallet and handed to a novice user, they might have **more** bitcoin (cash) the next time you meet up. These ""apps"" could live in a walled garden and eventually graduate out to other wallets.

Having several small apps integrated into one can often be more than the sum of the parts. There's a lot of things that can be done by utilizing small functions together that can't be done with isolated apps.

These are the mini apps:

- Chat(s)
- An index database
- Subscriptions
- Fungible Token Mining
- Limit Order Dexes
- Auctions
- Time locks (re: Hodl & Last Will)
- Yield(s) (FBCH & Badgers)
- Irrevocable trusts (re:unspent.cash)
- Integrated Accounting

The end product will be deployed in a unified platform with integrated web wallet. This app is going to be like a refresh of member or memo with CashTokens, but without the need for a custom indexer or specialized ""backend"" server. There's going to be less emphasis on the social media aspect and more focus on basic economic access and utility.

All of the ""mini-apps"" listed below will be small on-chain contracts. Some ideas are completely new and some are updated versions of earlier projects. It may seem like a lot of work, but the smaller the contract the easier things are to build, audit, and debug. 

This app will be funded through a [fundme.cash campaign #28, which and expires in July.](https://fundme.cash/)

This work is expected take about a year to build out. Most of the contracts are near completion and through testing. There is a budget of about 20 BCH for audits. 

**There are people in the world who want to take everyone's Bitcoin Cash to get rid of it as a currency. These people REALLY DO NOT IT LIKE when people save BCH―especially with defi contracts. There's been threats, harassment and ultimatums with this work, including by some people claiming to further the original bitcoin p2p project.**

**Please consider utilizing the pseudonymous properties of Bitcoin Cash if making a donation to avoid a DM from those folks.** 

For developers and bot programmers, most of these utilities will also ship as stateless libauth template ""mixin"" functions for any web wallet, meaning app developers can adopt a single component, or follow along with their idea on the same template and mainnet-js. The core functionality will also be an open software software library and command line utility, if someone wants to automate or integrate some component into their project or workflow.

Who am I? I develop software under the username github/gitlab account 2qx. I was a founding developer on mainnet-js; mainnet was originally suppose to have a [number of verbs](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810183217/https://mainnet.cash/2020-07-31) to closely integrate with BCH defi in 2020. In December 2022, I raised 60 BCH to further develop unspent.app, which was about six mini-app contracts (without a wallet or tokens). In 2023, unspent was reduced into just perpetuities as unspent.cash. In 2024, I raised 60 BCH to build futurebitcoin.cash, a recursive time-locking market using fungible CashToken series.

## 0. We need to have a chat. 

Right now, the places where the original idea of bitcoin can be freely discussed are in a fairly precarious state. 

One of the main platforms has recently announced a ban on the use of any cryptocurrency (except their preferred currencies), and it's based in a jurisdiction that is hostile to free thought and free speech. 

Another (older) platform is a now a publicly traded company with a bot problem. And being based in the United States, it too is now in a jurisdiction increasingly hostile to free speech and thought. 

And finally, there is the platform where bot engagement trolled a dull eccentric individual into bidding for the platform before he realized much of the engagement he was basing his decision on was driven by trolls and bots. It no longer seems like an app where many smart folks disseminate ideas. 

In short, we need a public group chat that's not vicariously controlled by a Russian actor, and where the ability to talk about and use the real bitcoin can never be rugged. So we're going to have a [public group chat on-chain](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/futurechan-a-message-board-contract/1541), utilizing NFT commitments as the storage medium. Messages will cost about 250 sats per byte, and old messages will get burned up to feed a future saving economy. 

With this chan, any message can be censored by anyone for 2500 sats per byte, and it will be possible to see which messages got burned early for those interested. Different channels for different topics will be supported. 

This app is a marketplace of ideas.

## 1. A reliable key-value database.

Similar to a group chat, just storing a little bit of data announcing the existence of a defi contract can be a significant pain point for many new small dapp projects. 

Currently, many dapps have built custom crawlers to index data stored on-chain using what are called ""op_return"" messages. Many apps are relying on public instances of [chaingraph](https://chaingraph.cash/), which is software that is expensive and non-trivial to run. There are also performance and scaling issues that arise with these indexers which often hampers the user experience in dapps.

So the second mini-app will be a highly distributed key-value database. [Small index](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/a-small-key-value-index-contract/1471) is a contract that will be able to store references and records to chat groups, auctions, trade offers and new long-running contracts. Data can be read from the highly reliable and scalable SPV index (fulcrum, electrumX or rostrum). Reading the records for a key will be as reliable as looking up the token balance of an address.

Records will be limited to 40-bytes (or the current NFT commitment length) and cost 1 sat per block to store. Miners will collect storage fees to clean up old data. 

This app is a market for data storage.

## 2. Subscriptions

Regardless of whether the fund.me campaign is successful, looking forward, it will be better for the ecosystem to have a more predictable funding model available. 

So there will be an ugly ""subscribe"" button in the app, that does nothing but hide the button for people that subscribed. 

The [subscription contract](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/unspent-phi-v3-timelocking-token-aware-contracts/1501#subscriptions-share-vesting-revocable-token-annuities-3) will allow anyone to create subscriptions paid out in any fungible token. Users will be able to cancel or withdraw their subscription balance early with an NFT baton held in their wallet. 

The subscriptions will be announced using the key-value small database from the previous step. Miners (or any enterprising party), will be able to collect a few sats for executing the regular installments. 

Easily creating subscriptions for content creators, app developers, podcasters and mods will be available in the mini-app. The app should enable predictable baseline revenue for many voices and creators across the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

**There will be no tiers or rent-seeking features for this specific project. Although other people may build apps utilizing gated subscription features, there's too much to do and too little time to try to milk people over sats, so, for this app, the subscription will only ever just hide an ugly subscribe button.**

This app will create a market mechanism for future support.

## 3. Mining

Novice users want to mine. So we're going to let them mine fungible tokens that can then be traded for sats. 

Bitcoin Cash previously had a minable SLP token called [Mistcoin](web.archive.org/web/20210128134553/https://mistcoin.org/), which was a project that saw immediate spontaneous adoption and a healthy secondary market. Additionally, an early iteration of Unspent Phi had a minable contract paying sats, which saw immediate uptake. 

So we're going to have a multi-threaded contract paying out tokens according to some half-life with an adjustable difficulty target stored in mutable NFT commitment―because we effing can. 

Eventually, if it gets big enough, the average of the difficulty targets across the mining threads can be utilized as a proxy for a [highly decentralized price oracle](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/research-block-difficulty-as-a-price-oracle/1426). That price oracle can then be utilized by other contracts to drive more stable coin markets. 

This app is a market to trade energy for tokens.

## 4. A Dex fit for a stablecoin

Users want stability. And the detractors of the idea of bitcoin often cite volatility (relative to fiat) as the first major risk to deter adoption among novice users. 

While automated market algorithms can provide liquidity across a very robust price range, we need markets to trade stable assets with a fair amount of depth at very specific prices as well. 

We need limit order markets. By storing limit order data in the commitment of an NFT, it will be possible for anyone to list tokens for sale on a contract, and then have [the contract allow](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/catdex-a-token-category-authorized-decentralized-exchange/1480) anyone to trade at the pre-defined order price. 

This app is similar to open ask limit orders on memo or tapswap, but it will allow partial orders and be bidirectional. 

Someone could fund a contract with sats to buy a token at a predefined price, and/or sell the same token at a higher price from using the same contract. 

Many users will be able to list their spreads for a particular token, and bots will be able to arbitrage across many contracts and dexes. Catdex has no commissions.

This is a market for a stable coin.

## 5. Dutch auctions for token price discovery. 

If someone sells a bunch of tokens, often the only record or price history is the initial token sale. Without active and liquid markets, there is no data to dissuade the ""investor"" that they're actually just throwing their money away on collectibles. Without liquid markets, collectibles can absorb liquidity, attention and mind-share, often without much merit or underlying utility to give value back to the user. 

On other chains, the value of NFT sets can eventually be estimated by records of on-chain English auctions. But auctions could also be very efficiently held on Bitcoin Cash for any type of token by using the age of the unspent output in [a Dutch auction](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/unspent-phi-v3-timelocking-token-aware-contracts/1501/3). 

The auction app will allow anyone to announce a dutch auction, and fund their contract with any number of fungible tokens (or NFTs) to be disposed of on their behalf. Anyone will be able to clearly see the current price given the starting price and the age of the unspent output. Anyone will be able to purchase the tokens in a transaction paying the consignor the current ask. Bots and traders will be able to arbitrage or trade tokens at auction with the same token listed as a limit order (or AMM threads). 

Users may cancel their lots by buying back their own tokens. Bidders can be fairly assured that lots will sell to someone. And the process of price discovery can be a reference to speculators of collectibles. Auctions will have no listing commissions or buyers premiums―only fees paid to miners. 

This is a market to liquidate tokens.

## 6 & 7, Absolute and relative time locks. 

Hodl-style and rolling time locks have been around for ten years. 

We've had these apps in the Electrum Cash as plugins. Users can lock coins until a certain time, or have their coins pay out to another party if not touched for some period of time. 

These ideas [will be refreshed](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/unspent-phi-v3-timelocking-token-aware-contracts/1501#absolute-timelock-bip65-hodl-style-vault-with-cashtoken-support-1) to handle locking CashTokens as well. 

Both of the contracts can be made to ""auto-complete"" via anyone-can-spend transactions, by announcing a record of the lock using the small key-store database (#1 above). 

These contracts market the idea of locking coins.

## 8 & 9, Users want reliable yields.

We have two dapps on Bitcoin Cash paying a solid yield without risking user capital on highly-manipulated markets.  

Users can stake coins for [Badgers](https://badgers.cash); or they can take coupons for staking [Futures](https://futurebitcoin.cash/coupons). In both cases, users aren't risking the loss of their capital to fiat manipulation or wild tokenomics. 

Both of these time-locked staking apps are perfect for a walled garden. They'll both have integrated support without any need to connect a wallet to an external integration.

This are yield bearing markets to lock coins.

## 10. Last irrevocable trust. 

An ultra-predictable stream of revenue is a wonderful thing. 

For almost three years now, the number of contracts streaming monthly payments to users has been growing, and they'll continue to grow with the fourth (more streamlined) version of the contract.  

[Unspent.cash](https://unspent.cash) perpetuities will benefit greatly from direct wallet integration, as well as better historical tabulations now available from mainnet-js. 

The next iteration will accommodate fees and payouts running below the current dust limit and propagation fee threshold.

On-chain irrevocable trusts are a market in time for users of Bitcoin Cash that know what they have and what it's worth.

## Bonus accounting.

Blockchains are great at keeping a kind of accounting ledger. Given a standard set of contracts, it's fairly feasible to map out what happened to user funds in a clear and deterministic way without storing notes or account nicknames on the blockchain. 

There is a rich set of tooling for plain text accounting that can let users manage and plan their income and expenditures in a predictable way. 

If we give people tools to make, earn and save money, it then makes sense to let them plan how to spend it. When all the mini apps are done, it'd be nice to have some limited accounting and be able to export the data upstream.

It’s been a couple of days now, and I’ve been trying to stay proactive. Every time Cripto Intercambio has reached out to me for documentation or additional information, I’ve responded immediately with screenshots, PDFs, and anything else they’ve requested. I’ve been cooperative at every step, hoping to get things moving again.

That said, I’m starting to feel stuck. I’m wondering if anyone here has gone through something similar with Cripto Intercambio or any other crypto exchange. How long did the review take in your case? Is there anything else I should be doing right now to help speed up the process?

At this point, I’m also curious if it’s even possible to request the swap be cancelled or reversed — just to regain control over my funds. I haven’t gotten a clear response on that from support yet.

It usually means sending your coins through bridges, dealing with different token versions, and using smart contracts. Miss a step or send to the wrong wallet and your funds might be gone for good.  
  
Thankfully, things are starting to get easier. Some new projects and platforms are working on more beginner-friendly ways to stake or move coins without all the technical steps. I noticed BABY recently popped up on Bg premarket and it made me wonder if we’re moving toward BTC staking without the need to wrap or peg tokens at all.  
  
Even if we’re not there yet, it’s still important to understand how wrapping works just to avoid mistakes. If anyone has a simple guide for how to wrap or unwrap BTC or BCH safely, I think a lot of beginners would appreciate it."
Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Receives Birthday Wishes: Details,6,1jsexsa,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-receives-birthday-wishes-details-3969465,0,2025-04-05 17:04:21," Today, April 5, the crypto community pauses to celebrate Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. According to his P2P Foundation profile, Satoshi listed his birthday as April 5, 1975, which means he would be turning 50 today.

Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, joined the celebration, writing, ""Happy Birthday, Satoshi Nakamoto. The mind that changed the world with Bitcoin.""

Satoshi Nakamoto registered his birthday as April 5, 1975, on his P2P Foundation profile, and this seems to be the only thing known about the Bitcoin founder. Given his privacy preference, it is hard to be sure if this is his actual birthday or one he made up.

Little is known about the enigmatic Satoshi figure, including his real name and whereabouts, whether he’s still alive, or if it is an individual or even a group. Satoshi’s birthday, like his identity, remains part of the myth. But whether it’s symbolic or real, April 5 has become a day to remember the one who started it all.

Key dates throwback
Bitcoin’s first block was mined Jan. 3, 2009. Known as the ""Genesis Block,"" Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto created 50 BTC with the move. Bitcoin white paper was released earlier, Oct. 31, 2008.
Sixteen years later, Bitcoin has grown from a near-worthless curio to one of the world’s most valuable assets — an appealing investment for prominent fund managers seeking to protect against inflation. With Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gaining attention, Wall Street has joined in.

And the network is stronger than ever, with mining difficulty and hashrate recently reaching new highs. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $83,686, with a current market value of $1.66 trillion. Bitcoin last achieved an all-time high of $109,114 on Jan. 20, 2025.


On Dec. 13, 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto made his final post on the BitcoinTalk forum.

Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, sent his last known messages to developers in April 2011, claiming he had ""moved on to other things"" and that Bitcoin was in ""good hands.""

Trump is already talking to Vietnam about reducing it's tariffs to zero, showing the tariffs are more of a tool/threat, I'm surprised markets haven't popped on this news, along with  non farm payroll beating expectation.   I'm still concerned institutions /whales may rinse cycle the entire crypto market regularly moving forward (up 20%, down 20%, repeat), the way the altcoin market has behaved.

Does BCH need its own compliant Stable USD?,32,1joen5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1joen5t/does_bch_need_its_own_compliant_stable_usd/,14,2025-03-31 16:25:45,"BCH had a compliant stable USD — USDh — years ago, yet the service was eventually discontinued. 

MUSD is good, but in my opinion, compliant stable USDs have unique advantages.

Obviously, neither USDT nor any other stable USD is likely to launch on the BCH chain, for two reasons:
	1.	BTC supporters are highly skilled at playing politics, making negative PR almost inevitable if anyone dares to issue USDT on BCH.
	2.	There are very few users or on-chain activities on BCH, which makes it commercially unappealing. 

Launching and maintaining a new compliant stable USD is expensive — it costs around $100,000 per year.

So here’s the real question:
If a company is willing to bear both the cost and the backlash from BTC supporters to provide this infrastructure, will it be fully supported by the BCH community?

Or will it instead be dismissed with comments like:
	“It’s useless, people can just pay with BCH directly.”
	“Just another trick to maintain fiat/dollar hegemony.”
	“It’s centralized, so it can be frozen or blacklisted.”
       ""BCH works perfectly now. Better than Stable USD.""

That is, if a company is willing to make such sacrifices, will it at least earn the admiration from a small group of people?"

The first one will drop to 0, while the second has no reason to rise due to large block space and tiny demand for it.

Therefore, this seems unsustainable.

Edit: I've just learned about the ABLA hard fork, which was supposed to address this issue, but it's still NOT looking good: 
As of March 30, 2025, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has an average transaction fee of approximately $0.0057 per transaction. With an average block size of around 50.41 kilobytes and assuming each transaction is about 250 bytes, a typical block contains roughly 201 transactions. This results in a total fee revenue of about $1.15 per block for miners.

"Using a QR seed from Jade with Nunchuck wallet, multisig issue?",0,1jjew93,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jjew93/using_a_qr_seed_from_jade_with_nunchuck_wallet/,4,2025-03-25 03:49:38,"I've been successfully using the Jade bluetooth setup with Green wallet for my cold storage, and decided I was ready to try the QR mode that it offers. But generating the previously created SeedQR and using QR Mode has not produced my original wallet.

The QR code that I copied down brings up a blank wallet in QR mode (I've copied it twice and verified the ID matches the original vs. the QR seed). I noticed that when I connect to Green via Bluetooth it describes my wallet as Multisig, but in QR Mode it will only accept the singlesig Xpub (which leads to the blank wallet).

I tried in Nunchuck with the QR Mode, both using singlesig Xpub or multisig Xpub, since it lets you add keys and then connect those keys to a new wallet, and get the same problem of a blank wallet either way.

I want to keep using my original seed, but I'm not sure why the QR Mode won't work - are there extra steps to export a multisig seedQR in Jade? All the demonstration videos I've watched of different wallets being used with Jade's QR mode do not address multisig Xpub.

Note: I recently updated my Jade firmware to 1.0.34 and the new UI is different than Blockstream's help pages now - not so helpful! Also I originally created a 12 word seed, and when connecting to Green as a new wallet I chose Multisig security. I'm thinking Green has a different definition than the ""multisig vault"" wallet that Bluewallet offers, or the Nunchuck option of adding multiple keys to create a multisig wallet. Anyone else dealt with this? Blockstream customer support has yet to respond."

If you're reading this and getting angry recognize 2 things:
- You probably have more invested than you can afford to lose
- Only plebs get bullish on a shoulder spike into resistance (oh hi 90k resistance on the downside of a 3 peaks, domed house pattern)
 

Bitcoin is likely nearing the end of its dominance — and historical tech cycles support that.

Here’s a pattern worth considering:

VHS launched in 1976, dominated for ~20 years, then was replaced by DVD.

DVD peaked for about 10–12 years before Blu-ray took over.

Blu-ray held relevance for less than 10 years before streaming and downloads made physical formats obsolete.

Each of these formats delivered the same core asset — video — but the platform used to deliver it changed.


Bitcoin is no different. It is a platform for the delivery of monetary value, just like VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray were platforms for delivering media. And like all platforms, it’s subject to replacement.

No delivery platform remains dominant forever. A more efficient, scalable, or integrated system will eventually emerge — and when it does, Bitcoin’s role will shift, just as every format before it has.

Taking the above fundamental analysis into account, and now looking at the larger macro Bitcoin chart pattern, there is a Three Peaks and a Domed House pattern playing out on the daily chart — a formation that has preceded many major market crashes from a technical analysis standpoint.

Based on the ridiculous amount of hype in this bogus top cycle, the empty promises from political administrations, and the clear pattern of platform obsolescence, it’s absolutely fair to ask this question:

Is it over — and are you going to be the greater fool who chases more gains, only to be parted with your value basis due to naive dollar cost averaging from near all time high? 

Friends don't let friends become somebody else's exit liquidity.

Anatoly Legkodymov, the founder of the crypto exchange Bitzlato, was charged by U.S. authorities under the previous administration, accused of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. After 18 months in MDC Brooklyn and a drawn-out legal battle, he received the lightest possible sentence: time already served.

Not quite.

Instead of being released, Anatoly was immediately transferred to immigration detention, where he spent 7 additional months behind bars. Normally, this process takes just days. Despite two separate court orders for his deportation to Russia, he remained detained with no clear explanation.

Eventually, he wasn’t deported at all. Instead, after those seven months in immigration custody, he was transferred back into federal prison.

Why? It’s now clear: French prosecutors, with the cooperation of ICE, used this entire period to prepare copy-paste charges nearly identical to the U.S. case and filed an extradition request. France is effectively dragging him into a second legal battle for the same allegations, disregarding the fact that the case was already closed in the U.S.

This raises serious questions about justice, fairness, and sovereignty. How can one individual be prosecuted twice for the same thing—by two different countries?

For the crypto community, it’s an alarming signal. If legal systems can coordinate to keep someone in prison indefinitely, even after serving their sentence, who’s next?

Some key dates when can push it for can be:

•October 31, 2008: Bitcoin’s conceptual introduction. Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin whitepaper, laying the foundation for a decentralized digital currency. This is the intellectual “birth” of Bitcoin, ideal for a day celebrating its origin story.

•January 3, 2009: The Bitcoin network launches with the mining of the Genesis Block by Satoshi Nakamoto. This marks the practical start of Bitcoin as a functioning system, a pivotal moment for its existence.

•May 22, 2010: Bitcoin Pizza Day. Laszlo Hanyecz makes the first documented real-world purchase with Bitcoin, spending 10,000 BTC on two pizzas. It’s a fun, relatable milestone showing Bitcoin’s transition from theory to utility—already celebrated widely in the community.

•February 9, 2011: Bitcoin reaches parity with the U.S. dollar (1 BTC = $1). This was a huge psychological and economic milestone, proving Bitcoin had tangible value and potential as a currency.

•November 28, 2012: The first Bitcoin halving occurs. The block reward drops from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, a key event in Bitcoin’s monetary policy that underscores its scarcity and deflationary design. Halvings (roughly every four years) are defining moments for Bitcoin’s ecosystem.

•December 5, 2013: Bitcoin surpasses $1,000 for the first time. This price surge brought massive mainstream attention, cementing Bitcoin as a financial phenomenon and sparking wider adoption.

•September 7, 2021: El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender, the first country to do so. A historic “best moment” for Bitcoin, showcasing its potential as a national currency and a bold step in global adoption.

•     March 6, 2025: President Trump issued an executive order for the “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile” (the Order).

"Schedule Bitcoin transactions by lock time, fees or price (my open-source project)",5,1jhnzbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jhnzbb/schedule_bitcoin_transactions_by_lock_time_fees/,3,2025-03-22 20:22:47,"Hi Everyone, 

I thought for a while about applications that could be useful for bitcoiners. I realised that there is no service on the market that allows you to schedule bitcoin transactions. 

The problems such a service could solve: 

* dead man's switch: allows someone to create a timelocked transaction that sends funds to a backup wallet if a user loses access to their keys or passes away, this would use nLockTime to ensure that the transaction is only broadcast after a certain amount of time
* Auto reset your blockstream green 2fa multisig by scheduling a self transfer transaction to a fresh address
* Transfer bitcoin when fees are low: create a transaction with a low fee and only broadcast it when fees come down, preventing it from getting stuck in the mempool
* Transfer bitcoin at a certain USD price: send your bitcoin to the exchange, or to buy a particular item only when it is at a certain price

My project allows you to do all this. It is an open-source API that allows you to post your signed raw transactions and only broadcast them when certain conditions are met. Transactions can also be removed from the service at anytime.

I had some deposits in 2021 that failed, and I was holding bitcoin with the instant deposit feature. The deposits never cleared and the holdings were slowly melting, without me even realizing. A few months later the company goes bankrupt and I don’t really think much of it until they email me a couple days ago with this letter -

“Voyager has claims against you and is prepared to sue you in connection with certain USD deposits”


There’s a link that takes me to a document from their attorneys, saying that I was being fraudulent and exploiting the instant deposit feature. I’m not sure what to do at this point as I don’t have the money, and they are threatening to litigate with triple damages. I’m in a bad hole and I’ve tried contacting attorneys for support but I’m not sure where to start. 

Is this credible? Will they take me to court? It’s approaching the statute of limitations of three years. 

Please advise. Thanks in advance.

Looking decades ahead, what will solidify Bitcoin’s place as a dominant asset? Will it be the continued erosion of trust in fiat currencies, generational shifts in how people view money, or something else entirely What do people think is the deepest, most fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value - and what will keep it rising for generations to come?"

Most people will end up losing money when investing in BTC.,0,1jev3zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jev3zw/most_people_will_end_up_losing_money_when/,12,2025-03-19 06:48:19,"With the market down about 20% from its highs, a lot of people on this site are freaking out. But if you've been in BTC long enough, you know this downturn is nothing compared to past crashes. If you can't handle the volatility, you're going to lose money.

Before investing life-changing money, put in the work to truly understand what BTC is. I started investing back in 2006 with simple S&P 500 index funds. One of the best lessons I learned from those early years is that most people don’t capture the full 10.2% ROI from the S&P 500 because they panic-sell during downturns and only buy back when the market is doing well.

Some of my best investments were buying during the 2007/08 financial crisis and getting into BTC in 2016. There have been some wild rollercoasters along the way, but that's part of the game.

That’s why I believe most people shouldn’t invest in BTC until they truly understand it. And when the market is down, the best move is to buy as much as you can stomach and hold for years. If you’re just looking to get rich quick, chances are you’ll end up losing money on BTC."

BCH: It's ok to accept defeat.,0,1jehrbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jehrbn/bch_its_ok_to_accept_defeat/,76,2025-03-18 17:23:48,"Sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is not my first language.
This is not a meme post, or an attack on BCH, it's just an opinion that i want to share and maybe help some people here.

First let's get some points clear:

- Have i bought BCH over the last year? Yes.

- BTC is the true Bitcoin? In terms of it's original vision, absolutely not (I will talk about this further).

- BCH is better than BTC? Yes at everything except price (but it's not BCH's fault, it's people's ignorance fault that prevents them from buying and making it go up in price).

So, why am I using this title?
Because, even with all these points that I just mentioned... BCH will not survive in the long run, and BTC will be the only one left at the end.

Let me be really clear: I totally hate this, BCH is far superior than BTC, and BCH is THE real Bitcoin in terms of what SN wanted Bitcoin to be.

But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. The most part of the market (specially the ignorant) decided to not follow SN vision for Bitcoin, they changed Bitcoin's purpose to a SoV only, and are trying desperately to create a MoE at the LN. And people are ok with it.

And there are other problems besides that.

The entire BCH narrative besides the ""True Bitcoin"", is that BTC cannot survive in the long run because of it's limitations, and when that happens BCH will receive the attention it deserves...

But that's not so simple. When the blocksize problem happened in 2017, with the blocks becoming extremely full, solutions came to the public, i agree that BTC solution is terrible and temporary... But it was a solution. In time of great need people are ok with changes, when the next Big Problem happens in BTC people will not change to BCH, they will think of another temporary solution that will convince most of the people and get BTC a few more years, and it will go like this forever.

People will not abandon BTC after all these years because its bad, they invested too much money on it, too much effort, they will simply find a solution (a bad solution like in 2017, but still a solution).

People are prideful, they don't want to believe they made a mistake (in most cases), they want to be right 100% of the time, and if they are not, they will adjust reality to their own desires.

Another thing is that most people doesn't really care about Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin, or the white paper. I think that we care about that because maybe we are some kind of idealists. But the reality is: Satoshi is not a God, he created Bitcoin, but at the end of the day, he put at the Bitcoin code that the network would follow to majority, not the ""best version of Bitcoin"". If the majority thinks that BTC is the real Bitcoin, it really doesn't matter if BCH is better, BTC is the real Bitcoin.
Satoshi's vision and white paper at the end of the day is just a personal opinion of the creator. But like I said, Satoshi is not a God, people don't need to follow his opinions for Bitcoin, if he wanted that he would make Bitcoin centralized, he gave up this power to let the ignorant majority of people decide.

That being said, nothing that I just said means that BCH will not go up in value during this cycle. That's not the point. The point is that, BCH narrative will never succeed, because people are not willing to accept that they were wrong about BTC. When the time comes BTC will adapt just enough to satisfy people's bare minimum needs, and BCH will never get the spotlight, and governments adopting BTC doesn't help at all BCH.

And there's another problem: Since most people are ignorant about all of this, it's very unlikely that if BTC fails and collapse completely that would benefit BCH, it's much more realistic to imagine that people would never want to hear about Cryptocurrencies ever again, because if the ""leader"" failed, how can anyone guarantee that the rest of the market it's not just as much likely to fail?

In my PERSONAL opinion, it's a lost battle.
Sure, we can make some profits during this cycle, and i do believe that BCH by the end of this bullmarket will perform better than BTC, but that will be the case for this cycle, not in the long run. It will follow the BTC pump like every other altcoin, but it will never achieve what it wants to achieve, because people will not change their minds to what the ""real Bitcoin"" really is. Most of them doesn't even know that BCH exists, or that it claims to be the ""Real Bitcoin"".

I hate this, because it leave us stuck with a much worse version of Bitcoin. But there's some stuff we can't change, life it's not fair.

And even though I believe BCH will perform better at this cycle, I'm always aiming for the long run, I know that a lot of people will not like this part of the post: But today I decided to accept defeat and swap all my BCH to BTC, and I will start DCAing in it. It will perform worse than BCH in this cycle? Probably, but I'm looking towards the long run.

As i said, I'm not making this post to attack BCH, and i think I made a lot of attacks to BTC. But I wanted to share my view on this topic with you guys. And wanted to listen to your views on this.

For all the ones that will stay in BCH, best of luck, i wish you guys just great things, as I said, I just think it's a lost battle in the long run. But I hope that I'm wrong and you guys get good results against inflation, at the end of the day, that's the best thing Bitcoin made for us, protect us against government incompetence."

I learned about it from Free Talk Live, like Roger did. I went to crazy Bitcoin parties in the woods in 2010-2013 for Porcfest  I mostly spent mine but kept a bit. I used to have hundreds, but I spent them in the Bitcoin economy. I didn't think this has biased me, but I fully realize it has and yet to minimize it.  I'm not a ""no coiner"" but would have been a multi millionaire if had held and not spent it to and make Bitcoin work.

And then THEY broke zero confirmation transactions which undermined everything I had been working on. Bitpay stopped working. I don't know whether or not Bitcoin was coopted... but would anyone attempting to undermine the project do anything differently? I didn't think so 

Bitcoin was the coolest. Hacker cash from the Internet designed to free us from the banks. Now it's a pet rock. All of the maxis are toxic and refuse to back change to the code.

Since maxis won't back changes to layer 1, I see a few of scenarios that could unfold. 

A - BTC needs to double in price every 4 years or the miners won't make money. If that happens, there will be a rift between miners and speculators that could crash the whole thing. The miners will want increased fees, or tail emissions. Tail emissions increase the coin supply which is fundamentally against bitcoin's only feature, being limited to 21m coins.

B - Quantum computers, or AI intelligence creates new math which weakens sha256. Nobody will update the code, so all of the value in Bitcoin evaporates.

C - Trump is successful at crashing Bitcoin down enough where the US gov can buy a lot more, then they have the ability to sink it and crash crypto whenever they want, regardless off an intention to hold it 20 years.

“The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

I’ve tried listing below some of those budget neutral options to help sell the bitcoin purchases to the public as non tax payer funded buys:


- Using some of the existing 39 billion dollars of emergency financial funds … AKA the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) which is a financial tool at the disposal of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It could be utilized to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) through executive action, without the need for congressional approval

- ⁠Seizing (stealing) more bitcoin including those holdings from people trying to use it to evade taxes

- ⁠Accepting government payments/fines/taxes in Bitcoin

- “Printing” money to buy Bitcoin would presumably not cost the tax payer (well directly anyway!) 

- ⁠Mining bitcoin with excess unutilised energy sources like Bhutan have been doing

- ⁠Selling other confiscated assets from crime (crypto and non crypto) for bitcoin

- ⁠Revaluing or swapping the existing gold stockpile for some digital gold


I’m sure there might be other ways for them to get more BTC without directly buying with tax payers funds… the fact they have actively pledged to do this and seem to have the personnel in charge who are motivated and from a crypto perspective pretty competent, qualified and experienced to do so is really bullish for the longer term bigger macro picture. 

What other methods could they use for tax payer neutral bitcoin acquisition …."

Bitcoin Sell Setup: Bearish Signals Indicate Potential Drop! 📉,0,1jatoi3,https://i.redd.it/h9zrd3vvgkoe1.jpeg,1,2025-03-13 21:31:00,"🚀 Bitcoin Sell Setup: Bearish Signals Indicate Potential Drop! 📉


Bitcoin's price action is flashing bearish signals, making it an exciting moment for traders looking to capitalize on short positions. Let’s break down the latest technicals and discuss a sell trade setup that could offer profitable opportunities in this volatile market.

🔥 Why Bitcoin Looks Bearish Right Now

📉 1-Hour Chart Analysis: BTC is showing clear signs of weakness, struggling to maintain bullish momentum.

📊 EMA Strategy (15-Min Chart):

The 9 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is crossing below the 15 EMA, a classic bearish signal that traders watch for short entries.

This suggests that selling pressure is increasing, and a further downward move is likely.

📌 Potential Sell Position Strategy

✅ Entry Point: $81,454 – This is a key level where fresh short positions can be considered.

  🛑 Stop-Loss: $82,000 – A crucial level to protect against unexpected upside moves.

🎯 Target: $79,100 – A reasonable profit target based on support levels.

📊 Key Resistance Levels:

$82,000 – If BTC breaks above this, short positions may need to be reconsidered.

$83,500 - $84,000 – Strong resistance zone.

📉 Key Support Levels:

$80,000 – A psychological level to watch.

$79,100 - $78,500 – Potential next downside targets.


⚠️ Risk Management Tips!

🔹 Use Stop-Loss Orders – Protect your capital from sudden market swings.

🔹 Leverage with Caution – If using leverage, manage your risk wisely to avoid liquidation.

  🔹 Monitor Market Sentiment – Bitcoin’s price action often reacts to news and macroeconomic factors.

🔍 Final Thoughts: Will the Downtrend Continue?

Bitcoin is showing strong bearish tendencies, and if the 9 & 15 EMA crossover continues to play out, we could see BTC drop toward the $79,100 level. However, crypto markets can be unpredictable, so always trade with a solid risk management plan.

It makes me wonder: if big money is coming back to crypto, what’s the next move for Bitcoin and mining companies?
Obviously, Bitcoin benefits directly — more capital flowing into exchanges means more buying pressure. But miners are the ones supplying new BTC. Companies like $MARA, $RIOT, and $CANG (which mined almost 1,000 BTC last quarter and is holding close to 2,000 BTC now) could be poised to gain a lot if Bitcoin starts flying again and supply gets tighter.
Does anyone think mining stocks will start moving soon? Or is the market still waiting for a Bitcoin breakout before jumping into miners?"

Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - Will generate $10 trillion/year?,0,1jadtgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jadtgt/strategic_bitcoin_reserve_will_generate_10/,14,2025-03-13 09:53:55,"At the Bitcoin Policy Institute on Tuesday (20250311), Michael Saylor said: ""**In 20 years the United States could be generating $10 trillion per year by renting, developing, or financing the assets in that strategic bitcoin reserve**"".

Would someone please explain how this works?

*Who pays the 10 trillion dollars to the Treasury?    Persons? Businesses? Governments?*

*What goods or services, i.e. what utility are they receiving for the payments?    What are they buying?*

Are the payments made in dollars? In bitcoin? 

Finally, how large would the bitcoin reserve have to be in order to generate 10 trillion dollars per year?

I'm not asking whether it's a good or bad idea, nor asking for any opinions about Saylor. These are serious questions, and I apologize if there are simple or well-known concepts behind this prediction.

Interesting Discussion,2,1j8y86q,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j8y86q/interesting_discussion/,31,2025-03-11 13:45:35,"I had an interesting discussion with a friend of mine recently. I told him that I had invested some money in Bitcoin and asked him what his thoughts on Bitcoin were. He answered that he thinks Bitcoin is not a good financial tool because it is connected to the traditional financial system and wouldn’t be able to exist without real money.

I don’t have enough experience or facts to prove him wrong, so I just nodded and listened to what he had to say.

Now, my question to all of you is: Do you think Bitcoin is worth the hype, or is it just a short-lived trend that will eventually disappear from the financial world?"

Lummis reintroduces bill for US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,0,1j91soe,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/lummis-reintroduces-bill-for-us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-93CH-3921792,2,2025-03-11 16:12:12,"Senator Cynthia Lummis announced the reintroduction of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act in the Senate, a move aimed at establishing a United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The legislation is designed to convert a vision set forth by President Trump into a lasting statute, with the intention of bolstering the nation’s economic base for future generations.

Senator Lummis expressed confidence in Bitcoin as an essential element for America to maintain its financial leadership into the 21st century. She highlighted the cryptocurrency as not only a technological opportunity but also a critical imperative for America’s sustained economic prosperity. The senator emphasized the role of digital innovation in addressing national debt and preserving America’s competitive stance in the global economy.

The bill has garnered support from a group of co-sponsors, including Senators Marsha Blackburn, Bernie Moreno, Dr. Roger Marshall, Jim Justice, and Tommy Tuberville.

The original version of the bill, which was first proposed in July 2024, outlined a plan for the United States to purchase up to 200,000 Bitcoins annually over five years, summing up to an acquisition of 1,000,000 Bitcoins in total. However, details regarding whether the current bill will maintain the same acquisition targets have not been disclosed.

The reintroduction of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act represents a significant step towards the institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency and reflects a proactive approach to leveraging digital currencies for strategic economic benefits. The Senate will now deliberate on the bill, considering its potential impact on the nation’s financial future."

Possibility of price-pumping attack against Bitcoin Cash,12,1j85jjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j85jjo/possibility_of_pricepumping_attack_against/,7,2025-03-10 13:24:48,"Something I'm wondering about:

What if TPTB, after successfully price-pumping BTC over the last few years, and stifling its adoption as p2p cash, now turn around and let BTC practically deflate (27% down from ATH already in just 2 months) while

- they can claim BTC failed (in its only remaining ""hope"", as a SOV)
- they can cheaply pump BCH price merely through converting the large amounts of BTC they've accumulated, accomplishing both goals of depressing BTC price to claim a general Bitcoin failure, and at the same time causing the same adoption hindrance on BCH that high price does on BTC (fewer people can afford it, leading to fewer people to try it, increasing tx fees, slowing commercial adoption which is the primary risk they face with BCH)

Just spitballing here.

It's not obvious how such a price pump to put BCH out of reach for many could be used as a vehicle for increased campaigning against Bitcoin Cash, but the old arguments of ecological wastefulness would transfer from BTC to BCH if it had both a high price and low transaction volume. And having a high price might transfer a lot of the speculative momentum, and thus enable the arguments of greater-fools-scheme and lack of utility that currently apply to BTC as the crippled Bitcoin chain."

Since they were wash trading the Tether, they could move the price way up. This process has stopped so all crypto is in the tank. It's that simple. Oh, and crypto prices correlate with stonk prices.  Get ready for those to tank too.



But pay attention to the long game: Silicon Valley VCs will take out banks with their shitcoins. They've got David Sacks as crypto czar, the SEC obstacle is cleared, CFPB is gone, and Blackrock has billions to burn. They can short everything for 3-6 months, extract plenty of value that way, and then buy back at fire sale prices. When they have cornered enough coin supply, they can launch crypto on social media platforms like X and Facebook. Overnight they'll be eating banks' lunch, they can't compete with instant free payment thru Twitter. The payments won't be taxed or KYCed so that adds to the allure.  From the consumer perspective it won't hurt to have choices other than letting a scumbag corporation store your money for you."

"Due to its limited block size, inflation will be required to keep BTC alive. Thoughts?",21,1j7iboe,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j7iboe/due_to_its_limited_block_size_inflation_will_be/,147,2025-03-09 16:34:33,"https://preview.redd.it/yhxove0ggqne1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf500f4355a64ecf51139e9275a3005670c15fb5

Some points:

* Miners only have an economic incentive to keep mining if`(block_size_reward * btc_price) + fees` results in profitability.
* The original Bitcoin project predicted that mining would be entirely supported by millions of transactions paying low fees once the block reward became irrelevant. This is not possible with BTC's limited block size.

**Therefore, BTC can only survive if there are enough transactions consistently competing for block space to the point that fees are astronomically high.**

BTC price alone is not a guarantee since the block reward will diminish overtime.

Given that less and less people are using the BTC blockchain due to its inefficiency, it could be that BTC will reach a point where the solution will be to **increase the total supply to more than 21 million by extending or increasing the block reward to keep miners incentivized, effectively introducing inflation.**

Obviously, such change will require a hard fork. If you combine this with the fact that Black Rock has recently stated that the 21 million cap is not guaranteed, I think we have a very good indicator of what is going to happen. Inflation has also been suggested by one of the Core developers in the past years.

In summary, BTC future doesn't seem bright.

Thoughts?"

Is difficult to enroll new merchants because not many people use BCH as cash, so there's little incentive for the merchant, And hardly anyone uses it because there's not that many places that accept BCH.

Here's were remittances might be the solution. The remittance market is estimated to be 41.22 billion USD only in the Philippines. If Bch could carve out a slice of that market it would put bch in the pocket of consumers, and that would be best incentive for merchants ever.

What's missing BCH to pull this out? Good old local bitcoin. A Dex where you can exchange Fiat for other tokens. 

How it needs to work to have a chance of success. 

Let's use MUSD as an example:
A simple UI app were you can load up an escrow with USD. Bank transfer or cash deposit in an ATM cashapp you name it.
MUSD is deposited in the recipient address the scrow releases the funds and keeps a fee.
The process could be entirely P2P and the only cost would be the escrow and network fees.

Tldr: remittances are key to mainstream adoption.

I come to you with a plea, not just as a fellow believer in cryptographic freedom, but as one who sees the tides of injustice lapping at the shores of innovation.

Roger Ver—yes, the “Bitcoin Jesus” himself—finds himself in the hands of a state that doesn’t quite grasp the gospel of financial sovereignty. The man who once evangelized Bitcoin before it was cool, who preached peer-to-peer freedom before it was profitable, now faces the wrath of a system that still thinks fiat is the future.

Now, we both know that U.S. presidential pardons are typically reserved for turkeys on Thanksgiving or well-connected insiders, but what if—just this once—the leader of the free world used it to acknowledge the right to economic freedom? What if, at the upcoming White House crypto gathering, you, Vitalik, the voice of decentralization itself, stood up and said:

“Mr. President, it’s time to free Roger Ver. Because if Bitcoin is about financial sovereignty, then its early disciples should not be punished for spreading the word.”

If anyone can make this case compellingly, it’s you. A few words from the sage of smart contracts, and who knows? Maybe Washington will surprise us all.

What do you say? Will you be Roger’s block-confirmation in the court of clemency?

With hopeful hashes and decentralized dreams,

Update: I should have guessed this would politically trigger some peeps, but that wasn't my intention. It doesn't matter who the figurehead is. The folks running things are dead set on taking prosperity FROM you, not giving it to you. They lie and tell you the opposite but, watch what they do - not what they say. You are not still early - you are being manipulated.

It is highly unlikely there will ever be another legit alt season and that digital money including BTC will be exposed sooner rather than later. The sheer nature of technology evolving will make crypto obsolete. You are all playing a game of ""greater fool theory"" chicken. 

We are being sent back to feudalism and AI will inform on all of us. They'll trap more of you in bags with this next dead cat bounce. How many will say, ""this is it!"" and throw $200k home equity at it only to get taken?

Those who doubt the ""you will own nothing and be happy"" directive from the WEF is alive and well are ignoring the writing on the wall - what is taking place is easily observable on macro charts for all markets by anyone moderately skilled in technical analysis.

Take the macro S&P index for example (monthly candles): parabolic step formation over the last ~50 years has likely topped. If you know what happens at the conclusion of these macro cycles, then you know what I'm saying is actually terrifying. This bubble will burst and take everything down with it.

This was the plan from the beginning. There is a really exclusive club pulling these strings and we are not members. There's a clue hidden in the Binance logo if you're sharp enough to catch on.

Stop listening to media, influencers, politicians, and hype. It's going to cost you everything and guarantee either your slavery or demise. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst. "

I created this website (and I am maintaining it) because I want to help realise a future of cheap free uncensored microtransactions with bitcoin. I am not asking for donations or support or help. But I will greatly appreciate if more people would try it out, upload some videos. Use it for free file sharing (as an ad free no hassle alternative to something like mega upload).

Holding bitcoin for 30 years,0,1j23uiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j23uiy/holding_bitcoin_for_30_years/,17,2025-03-02 16:49:07,"Welcome to my excessive rambling session as an inexperienced crypto person talking about bitcoin and my experience and thoughts.

It has taken me way too long to get into it but I guess better now than later. First time I bought bitcoin was in 2022 to play in an online casino, but I wasn't able to send it out on the website so I just left it there and forgot about it. 3 years later found it again and it was quite a pleasant surprise of 120 euros sitting there, 4x increase in profits.

But instead of spending a few sentences dwelling on the past and thinking how early I could have started (2020, 5 years late), I'm going to focus on the present and future and hopefully it still pays off even when so late. I don't have very high expectations, I'm hoping it would rise by just 2x-3x, or if it doesn't manage to rise at all in 30 years then that's not ideal but not end of the world either. I think it seems very probable that it would be higher in price in 30 years, seems pretty obvious? Why wouldn't it be?

I'm also getting my parent involved with this, but knowing them they're the type of person who just cashes their investings once they're a bit tight on money, they're not good with money, so I don't know how that'll go, but we will probably invest separately so my investments don't get spent.

I'm probably going to live a life without much money, so I hope at least when I get old I will at least have something to work with.

I'm investing it in my bank since the whole process of buying bitcoin is never easy and convenient, I've just had enough of it, and that's something that has made me delay buying bitcoin for the 5 whole years anyway since there was never an easy safe way to do it. I don't know if my bank or government will betray me at one point but I'm taking the risk.

I was really annoyed at myself for missing buying bitcoin just 4 months earlier at november because it was at 63k euros and I was waiting for it go lower before buying, big mistake. Then a month ago I was waiting for a whole month for it to drop so I can buy the dip, and I was really feeling that the price of bitcoin will go down to 75k euros (77.8k dollars) at some point, and it recently just did, but unfortunately I got impatient and thought if I wait any longer I will miss yet another opportunity to get it for less, and I bought more 1-2 weeks ago at 90k euros. And then of course it decides to drop in price almost exactly how I felt it would, close to 75k euro range, when I just had to wait one extra week or two to buy. But oh well, not going to sell anything for at least 30 years now, at least I hope so.

Now, to add on to what I said previously, I don't have the highest expectations for bitcoin, because logically, I don't see how it could go much higher than a certain point (like 500,000 dollars), because if there's already 5% of the world having invested at least some money into crypto, imagine such a huge population cashing it out, it doesn't add up, 5% of the population getting significantly richer? If the % was lower it would make sense of course because it has happened before, a few millionares out of nowhere isn't noticeable or that affecting, but tens of thousands of sudden millionaires or many accumulating hundreds of thousands? Doesn't seem plausible. So I think there will be a cap at some point or even a downfall, maybe the cap is now, even though I'm doubtful of that. So my expectations aren't high but they're high enough where I can still invest and likely get profit in the long-term. I will regret it a lot if I don't invest anything now and just look back 30 years later at the missed opportunity.

I also invested into other coins, and I have high expectations for ethereum and solana, solana seems really good because it's fast and convenient, if we're ever gonna trade crypto on an everyday basis, then we wouldn't even use bitcoin, we would use something like solana or eth, if they finish improving eth.

Oh, and also since I mentioned casino before, yes I still play casino, and I'm spending roughly 15% on gambling and 85% on holding, responsible gambling. I just hope the website doesn't turn out to be a scam.

Does everything I said seem right? Feel free to let me know if there's anything you'd disagree on or anything else, since after all I don't know much."

Offramping low 6 figs,88,1j0ifzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j0ifzc/offramping_low_6_figs/,16,2025-02-28 15:11:29,"
There’s been a lot of posts recently on Reddit about using centralized platforms for large crypto transactions especially when trying to get back into fiat. [This post for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCryptoBook/comments/1j089f5/when_legit_coins_get_frozen_without_much/) describes how a significant off-ramp went left because a portion of the funds was deemed as high risk on AMLchecks. 

It got me thinking about the importance of researching alternative methods for cashing out, like decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer trades, especially when dealing with substantial sums. 

What are everyone’s experiences with these off-ramp issues? 

What are the tax implications of such deals ?

PS For all the scammers DMing me rn - I'm nowhere near 6 figs yet !"
Am I paranoid or is Bitcoin just a giant meme that’s gonna eventually have it last cycle?,262,1j09azl,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j09azl/am_i_paranoid_or_is_bitcoin_just_a_giant_meme/,577,2025-02-28 08:46:28,"People keep saying Bitcoin is ""too big to fail,"" which is usually what you hear right before something fails. And now we’ve got quantum computers coming soon, plus ETFs, banks, and giant investment firms all jumping in. Feels like the hype bubble is getting way too big, and I can’t shake the feeling that one of these cycles is gonna be the last. Maybe not this one, but the one after Trump’s next term?

Like, what even is Bitcoin at this point? The price only goes up as long as there’s fresh hype and new buyers, but institutions are the last ones left to pile in. And let’s be real, they’re not here for the tech, they just need dumb money for liquidity. It’s starting to look like a glorified Ponzi where regular traders exist just to get farmed by the big guys.

Or am I missing something? What’s the actual real use case besides being an overpriced meme coin for anonymous transactions that normal people never need?"

Several good friends STILL don’t see Bitcoin as any different or unique in any way from all the other meme coins like Doge, Shiba Inu, etc..  They DO see it as a ponzi that just repeats the boom and bust cycle over and over.  They think that they can get in low and get out high, because they’re different.  

But what do they do, repeatedly?  They put in a few hundred, a few thousand and watch it grow, feeling very satisfied with their investment genius.  Then it “tanks” 10-20 percent and they believe, truly believe, that THIS time, it’s all over.  It’s going to zero.  So better to cash out with a 20% loss than not cash out anything at all.

Lather, rinse, repeat.

If you look at how long the panic sellers have held their coins, most haven’t even held them for 6 months.  The majority, not even one month.  They jump in at ATH’s and when it drops, they jump out, losing part of their money, enriching whoever just bought their BTC from them. 

Until BTC gets massive enough to keep these people’s irrationality from having such a big impact on the value, the rest of us will continue to have these value buying opportunities.  Someday, BTC won’t fluctuate more than a few percent and we will miss these good old Wild West times.

Do you want to know why bitcoin is crashing? Because You're Trading Like a Gambler,0,1j02qhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1j02qhh/do_you_want_to_know_why_bitcoin_is_crashing/,68,2025-02-28 02:03:19,"You’re here because you don’t take responsibility for your own trades. Simple as that.

You don’t analyze. You don’t think. You just follow someone, copy trades, or YOLO your entire account and hope for the best. And when it goes wrong? You come running back to that same influencer to tell you why it happened and that “everything will be okay.”

**You’re stupid.**

Before you even dream of getting rich, you need a plan for when things go south. What’s your move if your trade doesn’t go as expected? Double down? And if that fails, what then? You don’t have a plan. And that’s your biggest problem.

Stop following people who know as little as you do. They’re not selling success; they’re just riding the hype. This isn’t just about Bitcoin or crypto hype; trading is a battlefield where emotions lose and discipline wins.

Let’s be real: Trading, whether it’s crypto, stocks, or any other asset, isn’t a game of chance. It’s about weighing risks, making calculated moves, and taking full responsibility for your decisions. If you’re here to gamble, go to a casino. But if you’re serious about growing your wealth, it’s time to grow up.

Define a clear, emotion-free strategy. Move to automated trading. No one gives a f\*\*\* about your feelings.

Ask yourself: **If this goes south… will I lose everything?** If the answer is yes, then it’s time to grow up."

As you can see, Trump said a word about tariffs and bitcoin made a huge pride dump, as many investors were just scared and moved their money elsewhere.

We, as people who see the real advantages of Bitcoin, are not common species. Lets not live in the buble. Average person does not think like us. They want to use for payment as ease way as possible.

"New subscriptions are coming to Bitcoin Cash. [Discussion, Market Outreach]",7,1iytukk,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1iytukk/new_subscriptions_are_coming_to_bitcoin_cash/,4,2025-02-26 12:03:24,"TL;DR: We're getting Token Subscriptions on BCH, sooner rather than later. 

Subscriptions (i.e. recurring payments) aren't new to Bitcoin Cash. We've had subscriptions since 2019 with the [Mecenas plugin for Electron Cash](https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Mecenas-recurring-payment-EC-plugin/releases).

There was also a different approach taken in 2022 with the [Unspent Phi Annuity contract](https://unspent.app/documentation#annuity). While, not revocable, the Unspent Phi contract included ""automatic"" payouts―meaning recipients didn't need to interact with an app every month to be paid. 

Looking at the blockchain data, in the last six years, there were about 75 mecenas contracts created. The Unspent Annuity had about 167 contracts―but twice as popular in half the time isn't good enough. 

Unspent Annuity was released six months before CashTokens, the first version came out around the same time as the alpha of BCH Bull.

In 2025, there's now a few fiat tokens coming down the line, and a much richer token ecosystem to make using subscriptions easier. 

***

Over the last three years running a recurring payments ecosystem, users have overwhelmingly stated they want a few things: 

- Payments denominated in fiat amounts,
- Revocable or cancelable subscriptions,
- An easy interface, or protocol, for topping up balances.
- Transferable, or tokenized, ownership of the principal.

What is fairly clear, given adoption curve of products that have been built previously, users DO NOT want to pay a regular obligation denominated in satoshis for anything other than a novel experiment. 


***

Here's how the new subscriptions will work from a user perspective:

Alice has a software or service that she wants to sell via subscription payments to users. Users can be allowed to cancel after the first period. 

Bob wants to buy a subscription from Alice. 

- Alice has a website where Bob can select which token he'd like to pay his subscription with. Since no one wants to pay with BCH, that's not an option.

- First, Bob has to enter a token enabled cashaddress where Alice will send an NFT authorizing him to administer his subscription.  

- Bob can select his token of choice (MUSD, WBCH, BADGERS, ALICECOIN, etc).

- Alice can list different rates for different tokens, either hard coded or responsive to market price.

- Bob can choose how many periods (months, weeks, years) he'd like to subscribe for. 

- Bob clicks ""pay now"" to copy a payment request link for his wallet. 

- Bob pastes this payment link into his CashToken enabled wallet, which generates a standard transaction for Bob to approve. 

- The funding transaction has full token prepayment for the time frame Bob selected, as well as a few thousand satoshis to process each payment. 

- Alice can prove to Bob that the access baton to cancel his subscription has been sent to a different contract that allow forwarding it to his wallet after the first period is complete (so Bob can't cancel his subscription before Alice is paid for the first period). Or Alice can custody or send the baton to Bob early. 

- Once Bob funds his subscription contract, no further action is required from Alice or Bob for his periodic payment to be sent from this Subscription contract to Alice. 

- If Bob decides he wants to cancel after the first month, an NFT will let him cancel, adjust, rebalance, or generally administer his subscription balance. 

- If Bob wants to share or transfer his subscription, ownership of the NFT is equivalent to ownership of the subscription. 

***

Note that with this approach, if Bob chooses a ""stable"" coin token, the balance for the subscription is then locked to that fiat amount.  

If Bob pre-pays for a year in a fiat token and the price of BCH increases a hundred fold, Bob would still have one year paid in fiat amounts, not a hundred years. 

This approach is **NOT** fund that draws down dynamically based on a spot oracle price. 

***

If users have tried using Mecenas or the Unspent Annuity (or any other pusher style subscription service in crypto), are there any killer features or pain points to have or avoid? 

If anyone is interested in selling a service or software as a subscription, would the above scenario satisfy your business requirements?"

A $1 Billion dollar Bitcoin would have an astronomical market cap that seems impossible as it dwarfs our other market caps today. Maybe by then those market caps will be larger as well.

They close out their naked shorts and stop opening more causing the spot market to actually go up every time someone buys the underlying crypto. 



The reason is because these exchanges may short hundreds of thousands or even millions of coins, and ETF's are backed by spot coins held on coinbase, so if ETF buyers buy up all these ""paper coins"" Coinbase needs to actually take custody of the real coins.

 This will cause the bad exchanges to either market buy the coins they are short and transfer to coinbase, declare bankruptcy or claim they got ""hacked"" as we have seen in the past."

I was listening to an interesting podcast discussion today between David McDermott and Michael Engeman (Evolved Leadership Podcast) about tokenized gold and custodial bitcoin cold storage and whether putting bullion on the blockchain actually solves the problem. Some say it combines the best of both worlds—physical gold’s stability with Bitcoin’s portability. Others argue that if you don’t hold the asset yourself, you don’t really own it.

What do you think? Is blockchain-based bullion the future of gold ownership, or does it just add unnecessary middlemen? Would you trust it over self-custody?

"Any national ""strategic reserve"" is antithetical to peer to peer electronic cash (Bitcoin)",1,1iw4nqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1iw4nqf/any_national_strategic_reserve_is_antithetical_to/,48,2025-02-23 01:23:30,"Here's why.

Peers borrow money from each other all the time. Banks in my country restrict many peoples' ability to pay more than a certain low limit electronically via their mobile phones.

So when people need to buy something expensive, they call their friends (peers) and together they finance something by a couple of people chipping in.

Otherwise known as borrowing money. The banks are only payment rails in this scenario, don't bother asking them for money.

Now, the state, like a bank, _is not your peer_. 

Don't bother asking the ""strategic reserve"" when you need to borrow $300 .

Whereas with peer to peer electronic cash:

- firstly there's no limits other than how much money you have in your wallet. Unlike a bank, where you might have enough money, but not be allowed to spend it all at once (because surely the bank always knows what's best for your life)
- even if you needed to borrow money by having your peers co-pay for something, you can do it quickly and cheaply. Just send them the recipient address and the amount you need, and they can pay anytime, from anywhere in the world (this is also a huge advantage over banking apps for which you'd often run into security issues if you're in strange places)

National strategic reserve means those coins are tied up for purposes other than helping you directly in your life, like your peers would.

Maybe they can be used to bail out some banks.

Or to invade some country and plunder its resources for the benefit of rich corporations.

But when YOU need that money, it'll be ""_sorry, that's not a valid strategic use_"". Unless maybe you're a billionaire who can buy off enough politicians. But then you wouldn't need to borrow small amounts."

Long Monologue After Ban From r/Bitcoin.....,2,1ivehj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ivehj3/long_monologue_after_ban_from_rbitcoin/,21,2025-02-22 02:47:33,"r/bitcoin

Hello, You have been banned from participating in r/Bitcoin for 7 days because you broke this community's rules. You won't be able to post or comment, but you can still view and subscribe to it.

Note from the moderators:

No altcoin shilling here. 7 day warning.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team by replying to this message.

Reminder from the Reddit Admin team: If

you use another account to circumvent this community ban, that will be considered a violation of the Reddit Rules and may result in your account being banned from the platform as a whole. Bitcoin Cash is a centralized altcoin that uses the Bitcoin name in an attempt to trick users that are uneducated about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I will try to explain this all in simple enough terms that even someone that fell for Hoskinson's scam would be able to understand.

Bitcoin Cash was created because a group of Bitcoin miners in China that controlled a large amount of Bitcoin's hashrate were using a secret mining enhancement called AsicBoost that gave them a 20% hashrate advantage. Bitcoin was going to implement segregated witness (SegWit) and SegWit is not compatible with AsicBoost. The majority of miners did not support SegWit because they were using AsicBoost and they wanted to keep using AsicBoost. But the users that were running fully validating nodes activated Segwit on their own. So a group of miners that wanted to keep using AsicBoost created the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.

Roger Ver, Jihan Wu (the owner of Bitmain and AntPool), and that billionaire Calvin Ayre were all pumping the price of bitcoin cаsһ and Roger and Jihan were dumping a ton of BTC on big exchanges for BCH. The bcashers thought that if they could get the price of BCH high enough and make BCH more profitable to mine, then most of the Bitcoin miners would switch over and BCH's price would stay above Bitcoin's price forever. Their plan failed.

BCH currently only has 0.28% of the hashrate of Bitcoin (BCH is abysmally insecure. BCH's hashrate fluctuates between 0.1% and 1% of Bitcoin's hashrate) And there are currently only 568 BCH nodes. Meanwhile, there are approximately 98,000 Bitcoin nodes and there's even 16,810 public Lightning Network nodes. So there are currently 173 times more Bitcoin nodes operating than there are BCH nodes operating and there are currently 30 times more Lightning nodes operating than there are BCH nodes operating. Not to mention that a single group controlled 80% of BCH's hashrate for a long time (the same group that created BCH) and AntPool alone controlled over 50% of the BCH hashrate for years.

The fact is that BCH has no long term future and I'll explain exactly why in the following two paragraphs. 

In case you aren't aware, the transaction fees in each BCH block are always less than $5 worth of BCH, and usually less than $1 worth of BCH. Here is the most recent BCH block mined. As you can see, it only contains a measly 0.00016007 BCH (worth only 5 cents) of transaction fees and this is completely normal for a BCH block. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00108382 BCH (worth only 34 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00064719 BCH (worth only 20 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00039413 BCH (worth only 12 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00088536 BCH (worth only 28 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00100467 BCH (worth only 31 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00228548 BCH (worth only 72 cents) of transaction fees. And this is the BCH block that was mined right before that block. It only contains a measly 0.00140906 BCH (worth only 44 cents) of transaction fees. As you can see, having almost no fees in each block is completely normal for BCH. 

All bcashers are either scammers or they've been scammed themselves and they are just too stupid to understand that BCH having such big massive blocks and not really having transaction fees means there won't be any incentive for the BCH miners to continue mining BCH after over 99% of BCH has been mined in the year 2035. Maybe the same group that created BCH and that has always controlled the majority of the BCH hashrate will continue mining BCH at a loss after over 99% of the block subsidy is gone in 2035. But will the group that created BCH continue mining it without a block reward? Possibly, but BCH's hashrate would steadily be far less than 0.1% of Bitcoin's hashrate at that point (BCH's hashrate already remains between 0.1% and 1% of Bitcoin's hashrate). Another possible scenario is that they just hard fork BCH again and add a tail emission making BCH forever inflationary.

For comparison, Here is the most recent Bitcoin block mined. As you can see, it contains 0.0163934 BTC (worth $1,586) of transaction fees and this is completely normal for a Bitcoin block. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block.. It contains 0.01660747 BTC (worth $1,607) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.01600415 BTC (worth $1,549) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.01241646 BTC (worth $1,201) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.02334249 BTC (worth $2,259) of transaction fees. And this is the BTC block that was mined right before that block. It contains 0.03144001 BTC (worth $3,042) of transaction fees. As you can see, this is all completely normal for Bitcoin. In fact, this is the lowest that bitcoin fees have been in several years. And unlike BCH, there will actually be something to incentivize miners to continue mining bitcoin after over 99% of the block subsidy is gone in 2035.

The fact is that bcashers are holding heavy bags of a centralized altcoin that has no future. Some of the bcashers paid as much as 0.25 BTC for each single BCH after the chain split. The bcashers need to keep tricking more newbies into believing that BCH is the real Bitcoin and get them to buy their heavy BCH bags. The bcashers lie and spread misinformation and propaganda about Bitcoin. Of course none of it is true. The bcashers are just attempting to trick more people that don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency into believing that BCH is Bitcoin. Many of the bcashers have been scammed but are just too stupid to realize it and the rest of the bcashers are just scammers themselves.

GEMINI RESPONSE:


The message you received from the r/Bitcoin moderators and the subsequent explanation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is largely accurate in its description of the historical context and current state of BCH, though it presents a very biased and negative view.  Let's break down the key points:
Accurate Points:
 * BCH's Origin: The message correctly describes the split between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash.  The disagreement over block size and SegWit (Segregated Witness) led to the creation of BCH.  The role of miners and AsicBoost is also generally accurate.
 * Hashrate and Nodes: The disparity in hashrate and node count between BTC and BCH is significant and accurately portrayed.  BTC has vastly more hashrate and nodes, indicating much stronger network security and decentralization.
 * Transaction Fees:  The difference in transaction fees between BTC and BCH is a major point of contention.  BTC generally has higher fees due to higher demand and limited block space, while BCH has much lower fees due to larger blocks. The examples provided are plausible.
 * Mining Incentives: The concern about long-term mining incentives for BCH is valid.  With low transaction fees, miners might have less incentive to secure the network once the block reward decreases significantly.  This is a potential issue for any cryptocurrency with a decreasing block reward, including Bitcoin, but it's a more pressing concern for BCH due to its low fees.
 * Centralization Concerns: The message correctly points out concerns about centralization in BCH's early days, with a significant portion of the hashrate controlled by a small group.  While this has improved somewhat, it's still a point of criticism.
Biased and Exaggerated Points:
 * ""Altcoin Shilling"":  The initial ban message's phrasing implies a negative connotation to discussing any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.  While r/Bitcoin is a Bitcoin maximalist community, simply mentioning another cryptocurrency isn't necessarily ""shilling.""
 * ""Scam"" and ""Trick"": The message repeatedly uses loaded language like ""scam,"" ""trick,"" and ""stupid"" to describe BCH and its supporters.  This is highly inflammatory and doesn't promote constructive discussion.  While there are valid criticisms of BCH, these should be made without resorting to personal attacks or accusations of malice.
 * ""Heavy Bags"": The ""heavy bags"" analogy is a common way to describe holding a cryptocurrency that has lost value.  While some BCH holders may be at a loss, this is true for many cryptocurrencies at various times, including Bitcoin.  It's not a unique characteristic of BCH.
 * ""No Future"":  Claiming BCH has ""no future"" is a strong and unsubstantiated claim.  While BCH faces challenges, it's still an active cryptocurrency with a community and development team.  Its future is uncertain, but not necessarily non-existent.
 * Focus on Price: The message focuses heavily on price comparisons and the idea that BCH supporters are trying to ""trick"" people into buying it.  While price is a factor, it's not the only factor to consider when evaluating a cryptocurrency.  Technology, adoption, and community are also important.
Overall:
The message provides some factual information about BCH, but it's heavily biased and uses inflammatory language.  It presents a very negative view of BCH and its supporters, portraying them as either scammers or deluded.  While there are legitimate criticisms of BCH, this message fails to present them in a balanced and objective way.  It's important to be aware of this bias when reading such messages and to seek out information from multiple sources before forming an opinion.

While there are legitimate criticisms of BCH, this message fails to present them in a balanced and objective way.  It's important to be aware of this bias when reading such messages and to seek out information from multiple sources before forming an opinion.

My bank account got clean out,0,1ivw0u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ivw0u4/my_bank_account_got_clean_out/,11,2025-02-22 17:21:24,Someone got into my bank account and my information and use my cash app and put money in the Bitcoin and never saw my money disappear Untill I got alerted saying my bank account low balance. I thought I lost all my money but thank god my bank told me I will get my money back cuz it a fraud. But how did someone get into my debit card and transfer my money into my cash app and put my money in Bitcoin and have it send to someone without my identity and PIN number. Are we that dumb? It seems the scammers are smart than we are. But then again I’m not only one that happens. I never use Bitcoin. Is there a way I can block bitcoin in my app so this don’t happens again? I only use cash app to send money to my kids when they need to borrow.

AFoG is an automated gaming tournaments platform created by [u/Thanah85](https://www.reddit.com/user/Thanah85/), that uses BCH for instant prize distribution as soon as events are over.

Recently Thanah has announced that he's going to fund the big monthly Magic: the Gathering Arena tournaments out of his own pocket for even bigger prize pools, after already putting a lot of effort into the platform.

AFoG uses a guild system where everyone can create a guild for whatever multiplayer game they want, if you're not interested in playing MTG Arena (which is pretty easy to get into since you can get plenty of free packs as a new player), you can create your own guild and invite your friends or join the other existing guilds.

If you'd like to participate in the MTG Arena tournaments, the next big event is going to be on Sunday February 23rd @ 7PM EST/1AM CET, Thanah's guild is called ""Meeting of the Five"". This event has a 10$ entry fee, there are others that have no entry fee if you want to try the platform for free. Make sure to join the AFoG discord for more info.

One such company that stands out in this regard is Swisstronik, a platform designed to simplify the complexities of blockchain-based compliance, particularly with the implementation of MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) and other emerging regulatory frameworks.  
  
Swisstronik offers a solution that enables businesses to tokenize assets securely while ensuring they remain compliant with KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and the Travel Rule. This is particularly important as the global regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies tightens and governments move toward stricter oversight. For many companies, navigating this regulatory environment can be a challenge, but Swisstronik is positioning itself as an enabler of seamless integration into the Web3 space while adhering to these crucial compliance standards.  
  
The platform also leverages private computing, a key feature that enhances privacy and security in the AI and Web3 ecosystems. By adopting private computing, Swisstronik can help businesses harness the power of blockchain and decentralized technologies without sacrificing security or user privacy. This is vital as the industry moves toward more sophisticated applications involving AI, which can be integrated into blockchain solutions without compromising sensitive information.  
  
With the upcoming launch of Swisstronik’s TGE (Token Generation Event), the project is poised to attract attention from investors looking for ways to support compliant Web3 adoption. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, projects like Swisstronik that provide clear and secure pathways to regulatory compliance will play a crucial role in ensuring that the Web3 ecosystem grows sustainably and legally.  
  
For those already invested in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, projects like Swisstronik represent an opportunity to be part of the next phase of blockchain adoption—one that prioritizes compliance and security. As regulations continue to shape the future of crypto, solutions that bridge the gap between innovation and compliance will be critical to long-term success.

For newbies, back in 2022, Stronghold was accused of hiding issues with contracted suppliers, missed deadlines, and difficulties in obtaining new mining equipment. In March 2022, their financial reports revealed losses higher than they had claimed during their IPO a few months earlier. 

As a result, $SDIG fell, and investors filed a lawsuit alleging they were misled about Stronghold’s mining capacity, operational costs, and the feasibility of expanding its mining fleet during its IPO.

The good news is that the company finally agreed to pay investors $4.75M + 25 BTC over this whole situation. The deadline is a few weeks ahead. So, if you were an investor back then, you can check the details and file for payment [here](https://11thestate.com/cases/strongholddigital-investor-settlement).

Skilled in multiple programming languages: C, Python, Java, Perl, PHP, OCaml, JoCaml, Lisp, ObjC, and more

Still on the cypherpunk mailing list in 2000 under his dnet .com email

Wrote a manifesto in 2001 about making a mark without leaving a trace

Subscriber to cryptome.org in 2001


Early Signs of a Bitcoin-like Mindset

In 2003, Dorsey posted a bio mentioning his interest in crypto, pseudonyms, and 4 AM hacks

That same year, he declared he was ending his dependence on the U.S. dollar and was creating a barter network

Used the pseudonym ""Jak"" instead of Jack


Suspiciously Timed Events Around Bitcoin’s Birth

August 17, 2008: Jack, an avid sailor, tweets: ""Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way."" Bitcoin.org is registered the next day.

His Twitter bio from Sept '07 - Jan '09 mentioned that he was a sailor.

The original Bitcoin source code contains an old sailor’s adage: ""Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.""

Bitcoin’s source code documents were timestamped at exactly 4 AM, aligning with Jack’s known hacking hours.

Bitcoin’s source code includes a brute-forced vanity address starting with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7), timestamped 1/7/09.

January 10, 2009: Satoshi accidentally logs into IRC revealing a California IP address—Jack was in California.

January 11, 2009: First Bitcoin transaction occurs—this is Jack’s mother’s birthday.

November 19, 2009: Satoshi joins the Bitcoin forum—this is Jack’s birthday.

May 3, 2010: Satoshi’s last mined block—this is Jack’s father’s birthday.


Dorsey's Bitcoin Connections Post-Satoshi Disappearance

Jack’s San Francisco address was 2 Mint Plaza (jD2m)—he later sent Bitcoin to addresses containing ""jD2m.""

Satoshi tells Martti Malmi he is ""busy with work""—Jack was busy launching Square (now Block).

December 5, 2010: Satoshi advises against donating Bitcoin to Wikileaks.

December 14, 2010: Twitter receives a secret court order to turn over information about Wikileaks.

December 13, 2010: Satoshi disappears.

March 28, 2011: Jack becomes Executive Chairman of Twitter while still CEO of Square.

April 23, 2011: Satoshi sends his last email.

May 23, 2011: Twitter’s tech lead suggests Bitcoin integration.


Jack's Public Relationship with Bitcoin

September 2012: Jack calls Bitcoin an ""amazing movement"" and suggests Square will adopt it if widely accepted.

2013: Alyssa Milano, Jack's best friend, releases Hacktivist, a novel featuring a protagonist living a double life behind a pseudonym.

March 31, 2014: Square announces Bitcoin acceptance.

September 8, 2014: Satoshi’s email is hacked, and the hacker claims knowledge of Satoshi’s connection to St. Louis (Jack's hometown).

2015: Milano releases Hacktivist 2, where the protagonist’s famous pseudonym is hijacked, featuring a logo similar to Gavin Andresen’s Bitcoin Faucet logo.

August 15, 2015: Satoshi reappears on the Bitcoin mailing list amid the block size debates, sparking doubts about the authenticity of the return.

October 15, 2015: Jack becomes permanent CEO of Twitter.

2018: Square releases a children's book about the ""Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto,"" where Satoshi resembles Jack.


Recent Jack Dorsey & Bitcoin Connections

April 20, 2020: Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi—Jack coyly replies he wouldn’t admit it if he were. Unlike Szabo, Back, and Finney, Jack never outright denies it.

May 25, 2020: 145 old Bitcoin addresses sign a message calling Craig Wright a fraud. One of these addresses starts with ""1jak"" (Jack’s pseudonym). Another includes ""HiSQ"" (SQ = Square, Jack’s company).

February 2022: Jack starts wearing a Satoshi t-shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast, then at the Super Bowl.

October 27, 2023: At a conference, Jack states, ""Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.""

Early 2024: Craig Wright’s attorneys argue that if he is not Satoshi, the real Satoshi should come forward to refute the claim. Jack, through his involvement in the COPA v. Wright lawsuit, does exactly that.

July 21, 2024: Jack posts on Nostr: ""I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.""

August 28, 2024: Jack thanks Hal Finney (now deceased) on Nostr.

A Work of Art or a Hidden Truth?

The prevailing belief that Satoshi never wanted to be found is an assumption created by others. Jack himself has clarified that Satoshi chose pseudonymity, not anonymity. Given his deep involvement in cryptography, early Bitcoin-era events aligning with personal milestones, and his long-time cryptic nods to Satoshi, is it possible that Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin as a form of digital art? A masterpiece of financial revolution?

Or is he simply the ultimate Bitcoin enthusiast, subtly playing into the mystery?

What do you think? Could Jack Dorsey really be Satoshi Nakamoto?

For newbies, back in 2023, Binance was accused by the CTFC of listing unregistered securities as cryptocurrencies and paid social media influencers to promote these assets. One of the key problems was the BNB burn program which reduced the coin’s supply to boost its value. 

When this news came out, investors and users filed a lawsuit against Binance for hiding this info and the losses they suffered. 

The good news is that Binance agreed to settle with damaged investors (and users) and pay them $340K for the damages. So if you bought any token on Binance when all this happened, you can check the details and [file for payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/binance-unregistered-tokens-lawsuit).

Wondering where to go/who to talk to about making a crypto medium of exchange,0,1iopfsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1iopfsm/wondering_where_to_gowho_to_talk_to_about_making/,6,2025-02-13 12:11:27,"I’ve had a concept of a stable medium of exchange for a while and would want to make it a reality. I just have no idea who to talk to and where to look in terms of making it. And would also like some feedback and criticism on my concept. If anyone has any advice to provide that would be greatly appreciated

Here's an explanation of the system as requested...

The concept surrounds balancing out 3 different extremes that apply to all currencies used in society. Equality/Equity (tax rate), Centralization/Decentralization (tax allocation), and Inflation/Decentralization (supply-demand).

I approach it using a 3D graph (x: tax rate, y: tax allocation, z: supply-demand).  Once doing this, you see that the X-axis extremes are: 100% - 0% tax.  The Y-axis extremes are: All the tax goes to the government (Centralization) - All tax goes to the people (Decentralization/UBI).  The Z-axis extremes are: Supply outpaces demand (Inflation) - Demand outpaces supply (Deflation).

Once graphing it out, you see that they are equal opposites of each other... the reasons inflation is good are the reasons that deflation is bad and vice versa... this applies to all the axes.  So the logical conclusion for a proper medium of exchange is to not have any leaning toward the extremes (x,y,z +/-)...

Once you have that conclusion, you see that the perfect medium would consist of a... 50% tax rate (sounds high but I can get into it*) where half of the tax goes to the government, through a split of equality/equity means (can get into that later too**), and the other half of the tax goes into UBI, also through equality/equity means, and has a per capita supply (matching supply to demand).  Doing this cancels out all the extremes and leaves you at (0,0,0) on the graph.

The point of this currency is to provide an autonomous medium of exchange that balances out the extremes of manipulation of value... the current issue I'm having is to find a way to produce it/receive constructive criticism on what may be wrong with it and how to improve it.

*a majority of this tax is refunded... its ""high"" because it's part of the calculation
**Equality/equity means has to do with the splitting of funds... for example: 100$ needs to be split between 2 people through equality/equity means.  Person 1 previously had 10$ and Person 2 previously had 90$.  The new 100$ is split into 2 portions, 50$ into the equality portion and 50$ into the equity portion.  In the equality portion, that 50$ is split based on the amount of people.  Therefore, both Person 1 and 2 will receive 25$ of this portion.  The equity portion is split based on equity.  Person 1 has 10% of the total previously owned capital and Person 2 has 90% of the previously owned capital.  Therefore, Person 1 receives 5$ and Person 2 receives 45$. In the end, Person 1 received 30$ (now at 40$ total) and Person 2 received 70$ (now at 160$ total)"

It works with Spot market only for now and I am researching for a development. It is 10% profit from whole amount for like 5 months span. Have any ideas what are the vectors which I need to look next.

For now to achieve X profit I need to make buy-sell order for an amount like 400 times X.

I’ve always kept my BTC in my own wallets, but ever since I started using BananaGun for trading, and I realized how much control actually matters. The bot generates a personal wallet for you, which is great for security, but also means no one else should ever have access. If I let someone else use it, I might as well just hand them my private keys.

It made me wonder why are so many people comfortable trusting someone else with their Bitcoin? Do you think most people actually understand self-custody, or are we just one big exchange collapse away from another wake-up call?"

But my EC wallet didnt have the funds so I copied the address and the amount from Electron Cash into Ledger Live and made the payment. I sadly watched the invoice time out and then disappear (but I took screenshots!)

Now BitPay is saying there is no such payment related to the InvoiceID and can't help me.

To quote them directly:

> This transaction does not belong to a BitPay Invoice (TXID).


I took notes and screenshots when I saw two confirmations, but the bitpay invoice remained marked Unpaid.

TLDR: I sent ~9 BCH to BitPay and they never credited me nor will they refund the payment. I have been calling them daily for a week and emailing almost daily too.

Is BitPay screwing me?

UPDATE: After 3 weeks, 7 phone calls, ~20 emails, BitPay returned the missing funds.  If I had given up after the first 5 times they told me there was nothing they could do, that it was my fault, or if I had believed any of that - I would have lost $3000 to their EXTREMELY poor support system.  BitPay blamed the error on Electron Cash generating the wrong BCH address based on the BitPay InvoiceID, but there is only BitPay to blame for refusing to do anything or accept responsibility until I made this thread.

In cases like this the merchant can't do anything and will simply refer you to BitPay.  So it's like you are buying from Apple but if there's a problem, Apple says talk to BitPay (who has almost zero support (See Below)).  You are basically screwed unless you are a persistent little thorn in their side, like me, calling and emailing daily and having the technical knowledge to know I didn't fuck up, they did.

If you are a merchant, or making large purchases, I suggest staying very far away from BitPay. Personally I will never use BitPay again.

FYI BitPay has a ""support"" phone number, but they actually don't provide phone support for issues like this.  Their phone tech support don't even understand the very basics of how bitcoin transactions work and they readily admit the phone support is only for the Bitpay Card."

📅 Date: Tuesday

⏰ Time: 6 PM EST

What’s it about?

We’ll be joined by Tom, the kid behind a 10-minute YouTube video from 2011 where he explained what Bitcoin was and even made some bold predictions—all when he was just 12 years old.

The crazy part?

The video went completely undiscovered for 14 years until it was recently unearthed, sparking the creation of $TPU.

🎙 Set a reminder for the Twitter Spaces: [https://x.com/0xSkip/status/1888744941112656350](https://x.com/0xSkip/status/1888744941112656350)

Topics we’ll cover:

•📜 Tom’s story: What led him to create the video in the first place.

•🚀 Going viral: His reaction after the video blew up more than a decade later.

•🌍 $TPU community: Growth, future plans, and how the story is spreading to major media outlets.

If you’re into crypto history, early adoption stories, or just want a unique perspective on Bitcoin’s early days, this is a must-listen.

But since there is finally an update, I thought I could share it again.



Quick recap — in 2023, O’Neal was accused of hiding the risks of buying NFTs and not warning about the losses investors could have (and actually had) if the platform went down. 



In November 2022, the platform shut down without any explanation or refunds for those who had purchased what turned out to be unregistered securities. As a result, investors filed a lawsuit against Shaquille O’Neal.



As you might know, Shaquille O’Neal finally agreed to pay $11M to investors who bought its NFTs. And, the good news is that the court approved the settlement. So, if you were damaged you can check the details and [file to get payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/astrals-investors-settlement).



Anyways, has anyone here bought back then? How much were your losses if so?

I’ve seen platforms like CoinGate and similar services freeze funds, so I want to ensure that once I charge a customer, I can immediately withdraw the money to prevent any risks.

I’d love to hear from others:

✅ What are the best platforms or services for this?

This is not what satoshi created BTC for.

We all should organize against this

Im looking for serious blockchain and smart contract developers, to make the protect im attaching below.

Whitepaper: BTC Community Staking Protocol (BCSP)

Introduction

The BTC Community Staking Protocol (BCSP) is a decentralized protocol designed to organize the Bitcoin holder community and reduce the circulating supply, generating a positive impact on its price and stability without whale manipulation. Unlike traditional staking systems, BCSP does not allow whales or centralized entities, ensuring an equitable distribution and 100% decentralized governance.

2. Problem

Currently, the cryptocurrency market is dominated by large investors ('whales') and entities that manipulate BTC cycles. Small and medium holders lack organization and power over the BTC supply, leading to:

Price instability.

Loss of trust within the community.

Dependence on speculative trading rather than long-term holding.

Solution: BTC Community Staking Protocol

We still got the mayority of btc but wont last much more with the institutions and big whales playing the game. More than half of the existing btc are in ''small'' hands, in plenty of wallets.

3.1. BTC Locking with On-Chain Transparency

Holders can lock their BTC in smart contracts for defined periods (e.g., 2, 5, or 10 years). Information about the locked BTC will be public, allowing the protocol's strength and its impact on reducing circulating supply to be demonstrated.

3.2. Incentive for Holders: $BTCU Token

To reward those who lock BTC, a native token, $BTCU, is issued based on the amount of BTC locked and the staking duration. The issuance of $BTCU is limited and deflationary to ensure its long-term value.

Distribution of $BTCU:

1 BTC locked for 2 years ➞ 100 $BTCU

1 BTC locked for 5 years ➞ 250 $BTCU

1 BTC locked for 10 years ➞600 $BTCU

Gradual distribution: Tokens are released progressively according to the lock duration to prevent market dumping.

3.3. Decentralized Governance (DAO) BCSP will be managed by the community through a DAO system, where $BTCU holders can vote on key decisions:

Changes in staking parameters.

Use of potential development funds.

Implementation of new features.

3.4. Liquidity and Flexibility

To avoid liquidity loss for holders:

Locked positions can be traded on a secondary P2P market.

$BTCU token can be used in DeFi as collateral on decentralized lending platforms.

Security and Regulation

BCSP will be 100% decentralized and intermediary-free, with:

Audited smart contracts to ensure security.

Open-source code, allowing community verification.

No fixed return promises, only incentives based on real supply and demand.

Roadmap

Phase 1: Development of the smart contract and testing on the testnet.

Phase 2: Launch of the protocol and initial staking.

Phase 3: Implementation of DAO and decentralized governance.

Phase 4: Expansion of integrations with DeFi platforms.

Phase 5: Global growth and mass adoption.

Conclusion

The BTC Community Staking Protocol is the first initiative to unite BTC holders in a collective effort, free from whales and institutional manipulation. The combination of transparent staking, well-designed incentives, and decentralized governance could mark a turning point in the crypto ecosystem, making us(the mayority) the ones with the control over it and not them."

As someone who's been in DC for the last 3 years lobbying for Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, these campaigns really do make a difference since congressional offices need to hear from their constituents why they should care about Bitcoin. The more letters an office receives on Bitcoin, the easier it is for me when I talk to staffers on Capitol Hill since they will remember how many of their constituents contacted their office to support Bitcoin.

If you've ever wanted to make your voice heard and advocate for Bitcoin, [**please use this tool**](http://satoshiaction.quorum.us/campaign/whybitcoinstockpile) **to ask your elected officials to support Bitcoin in a strategic reserve**.

You can check this [X post from Dennis Porter](https://x.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1885426681462350130) to learn more information about this campaign.

Thanks so much for your help and using this tool is 100% free. We're hoping to get as many people as possible from the Bitcoin community to contact DC politicians to let them know why BTC must be in a strategic reserve.

Thanks all and I hope everyone has an excellent weekend."
My take on why btc might range for another 3 to 6 months,0,1ijukbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ijukbh/my_take_on_why_btc_might_range_for_another_3_to_6/,7,2025-02-07 07:07:17,"We are the most bullish stage of btc ever but price is stalled.

I believe it can remain so for a few more months:

- M2 supply which is highly correlated to btc needs to increase first, and for now the FED is still on quantitative tightening mode, so if in march they stop the QT process or even start quantitative easing, it could be a catalyst 
- the US has around 6 months to either approve or reject the SBR (I believe it will pass) which puts it around june/july, another potential catalyst for btc
- we have been seeing transfers of btc (on chain) from binance and coinbase to wintermute, and wintermute (a market maker) performs OTC transactions between parties, which effectively don’t affect the price of btc: and to me this can either mean one of two things:

1. They are actively suppressing the price by countering all the buys in the market in order to let institutions, governments etc to accumulate at a lower price covertly, or
2. There are players that are buying btc over the counter accumulating without moving the price.

Either way, this could go on for several months until the approval of btc SBR according to the btc reserves in binance and coinbase.

I speculate that btc will only top by end of year due to this, and altcoins will see a very late rally, because btc first needs to attract retail, go up in dominance and finally drop the dominance as whales rotate to smaller coins.

That’s just my speculation. What are your thoughts?"

I want to prove with data & facts that anything priced in BTC goes down, the same item priced in Fiat goes up due to inflation & currency debasement.

To do so, I need datasets showing the yearly average price of a good/service from 2008 until 2024 (or similar). No indexes, CPI, etc, but actual average prices across years.

For example, think about: the average yearly cost of a new house; average yearly cost of child care service; average yearly cost of a full tank of gasoline; average yearly cost of a new car; etc etc.

Ideally, data must come from sources, such as government authorities, institutional research institutes, research/statistic firms, or reliable websites like Statista or similar.

Are there any proposals or research on making bitcoin's PoW useful for real-world computation?,4,1ija9j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1ija9j7/are_there_any_proposals_or_research_on_making/,5,2025-02-06 12:57:55,"Bitcoin’s **proof of work (PoW)** mechanism secures the network by requiring miners to perform massive amounts of computations to find a valid nonce. However, these computations—though essential for Bitcoin’s security—are **purely wasteful in terms of real-world utility**, as they serve no purpose beyond reaching the target hash.

**Are there any proposals, research papers, or experimental ideas** exploring ways to make PoW contribute to **useful computational tasks** while still maintaining Bitcoin’s security?

For example, could mining be designed to also perform:

* **Scientific simulations**
* **Protein folding** for medical research
* **AI model training**
* **Other forms of distributed computing**

If such ideas exist, what are the **technical and economic challenges** preventing their implementation? Would altering PoW in this way compromise Bitcoin’s decentralization or security?

I’ve been very interested in bitcoin lately. I first heard about it 7 or 8 years ago but never bothered to really look into, until a few months ago. Don’t get me wrong I find BTC very appealing and I understand its perks (decentralised, cap on the amount of BTC, etc.). I even bought some (in small amount). But the (a part of the) community around it makes it really unappealing for newcomers. Some posts on this sub (well, rather the other btc sub, but they won’t let me post this) are akin to what you would find on conspiracy theories or cult forum, going like “we’ve been lied to since forever with government-issued fiat money who is now bound to collapse anytime now, hopefully I found the Truth and took the btc red pill and I’m glad to be part of the pioneering elite that discovered the undeniable power of Bitcoin before the ignorant masses that will have no choice but to buy it when btc will be worth 20M$”. Yeah ok settle down, BTC is a great asset but it doesn’t hurt to realise that it is not a flawless godsend gift. This atmosphere just has a scam-like unpleasant smell attached to it, and it can be off-putting for newcomers I think. Again it’s not everyone but a non-negligible share of what I read around here."

I've already had my own concerns about the future of reddit for a few years now, but with the API changes and various other issues the concerns have become a lot more serious and urgent, and I'm wondering if we should move the community off reddit (in this case this subreddit would serve as a pointer - but unfortunately there's still no obvious replacement).

Resurrecting an old topic - does Snapchat employ E2EE?,9,1k14y1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1k14y1r/resurrecting_an_old_topic_does_snapchat_employ/,4,2025-04-17 00:05:33,"I posted this (or similar) article awhile ago: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68056421

TL;DR: British person sends a message in SnapChat *""On my way to blow up the plane (I'm a member of the Taliban).""* in a group chat with friends as a joke at Gatwick airport (via the WiFi) before departing. UK authorities (somehow) picked it up and flagged it to Spanish authorities while he was mid-flight. Two Spanish jets were sent to flank the aircraft until it was grounded, searched, and then the British person was arrested.

There's been a few theories:

* TLS was MITM'd at the airport - not one I fully understand, I'm guessing by means of injecting a CA, but this is extremely uncommon, I don't think any airport does this, maybe Kazakhstan.

* SnapChat is not E2EE. At RWC 2019 Snapchat [presented](https://rwc.iacr.org/2019/slides/snap.pdf) enabling E2EE for Snaps (video content), but there was nothing said about messages. It is even possible that one to one messages are E2EE, but maybe not group chats.

* SnapChat does client side scanning and flags anything inappropriate.

* Someone in the group chat reported/flagged the message.

Curious what people think? I think all the above points except the TLS MITM are plausible both independently and together. There doesn't seem to be any current reverse engineering analysis of the SnapChat app, so I'm not sure anything is confirmed."

\----------------------------------------

I'm an independent developer with a long-standing interest in cryptographic systems and secure algorithm design. Over the past year, I’ve been working on a symmetric key-based random substitution cipher and a pair of encryption algorithms built on it.

This effort has led to the creation of the **SAS-ROS Cipher** (*Random Object Substitution*), and two encryption algorithms that build on it:

* **SAS-RCS** (*Random Character Substitution*) .
* **SAS-RBS** (*Random Binary Substitution*) .

These algorithms, implementation, documentation and related tools are available as a part of the **free** & **open-source** **SAS-ROSET** Project. ***Credits will be given on the project website's Credits page.***

# .

# Note

This post is not intended to market or promote a product. My goal is to:

* Share the design with the cryptographic community
* Invite review and critique of the theoretical model
* Explore potential weaknesses and attack surfaces
* Learn from experts and enthusiasts alike

I fully understand that substitution-based systems are often considered weak or outdated. However, I believe the **dynamic, randomized nature** of this cipher and its encryption algorithms offers a fresh perspective on how substitution can be applied. Even if not practical for production, it may prove valuable as a hybrid component — or at the very least, serve as an educational tool for those exploring cryptographic design.

In this post and the official documentation, I’ve shared all current findings, conclusions, and assumptions. These are subject to change as research progresses. I also acknowledge that **some conclusions may be inaccurate or incomplete**, which is why **further analysis and external input are essential**. The **algorithms remain open to improvement**, and **contributions from the community** are not only welcome — **they’re genuinely appreciated, and will be credited**.

***If you find any part of the official documentation unclear or feel that it lacks important details, please don’t hesitate to let me know - I’ll do my best to address it as quickly as possible.***

# Overview of SAS-ROS Cipher

**SAS-ROS** (Saaiq Abdulla Saeed's Random Object Substitution) is a randomized, key-driven substitution cipher. It performs object-level substitution by using two keys — a **Dynamic Key** (a permutation of objects) and a **Static Key** (a permutation of indexes) which together represents a **substitution table**. Unlike traditional substitution ciphers, it introduces randomized transformations determined by keys. The cipher is  format-agnostic: an “object” can be a character, bit, frequency, etc.

**Dynamic Key** \- (Object Array) A randomly shuffled set of *objects.*  `Example: for the characters ""abcdef"" a Dynamic Key permutation can be: { c, e, a, d, f, b }`

**Static Key** \- (Index Array) A randomly shuffled set of indexes (0 to N–1) `Example: { 2, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3 }`

These two types of keys with SAS-ROS methods form a **bijective mapping**, hence a **substitution table**.

There are two methods to perform the ROS Cipher, which are inverses of each other. Therefore, if one method is used for encryption, the other can be used for decryption, and vice versa. Below is a quick demonstration for **SAS-ROS Method 1 (m1)**:

    Dynamic Key: { j, i, d, a, h, c, g, f, e, b }
    Static Key : { 4, 8, 2, 7, 1, 6, 0, 5, 9, 3 }
    Data: b
    1. Locate the index of 'b' in Dynamic Key - [9]
    2. Retrieve the integer in the [9] index of the Static Key - 3
    3. Identify the character in the [3] index of Dynamic Key - 'a'
    4. Substitute 'b' to 'a'
    Output: a

The **effective key space** for the SAS-ROS Cipher is **L! (factorial of the key length)**, representing all possible permutations of a set of `L` distinct objects — essentially all possible substitution tables.  
This large key space is what provides the foundation for the cipher’s resistance to brute-force attacks, especially when used with sufficiently large key lengths.

*Refer to the official documentation for more details including methods, laws, attacking.*

# .

# Overview of SAS-RCS/RBS Encryption Algorithms

The **SAS-RCS** (Random Character Substitution) and **SAS-RBS** (Random Binary Substitution) algorithms are built around the SAS-ROS Cipher but introduce **several additional layers of transformation** to enhance security and usability.

Each algorithm is tailored to a specific data type:

* **SAS-RCS** is optimized for Text-Level Encryption
* **SAS-RBS** is optimized for Binary-Level Encryption

Unlike the core SAS-ROS Cipher - which uses a single Dynamic Key and Static Key pair - these algorithms employ:

* **A single Dynamic Key**
* **Multiple Static Keys**, enabling the generation of **multiple substitution tables**

This approach helps **mitigate frequency analysis** and increases overall variability.

Both algorithms also include two key steps:

1. **Obfuscation:** Extra data objects are inserted into the original data based on a fixed **n:m ratio**. That is, for every **n data objects**, add **m random objects** (objects drawn from the Dynamic Key).
2. **Randomized Shuffling:** The entire data set undergoes a **deterministic shuffle** using all Static Keys, which act as sources of random numbers used for swapping operations while shuffling.

# .

# Key Length & Key Space

These algorithms support **variable key lengths** of up to approximately **1,050,000 objects**.

* For a key length `L`, the effective key space is **L! (L factorial)**, representing all permutations of a key of that length.
* This means the **theoretical maximum key space** currently reaches up to **1,050,000!** — an astronomically large number.

It’s worth noting that the **practical entropy** and **effective strength** of the key space may be affected by structural patterns or simplifications in implementation. Until further empirical research is completed, the full factorial key space is assumed as the theoretical upper bound.

# .

# How to Use the Algorithms in Practice

**ROS Encryption Tool**

To demonstrate, use and test the SAS-RCS/RBS Encryption Algorithms, I’ve developed a graphical tool called **ROSET** (**ROS Encryption Tool**). This tool provides complete access to the algorithms with full access to all customizable parameters. Tool supports both file and text encryption.

* Cross-platform: Available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**
* Portable: **No installation** required — runs as a standalone application
* Customizable: Users can **tweak algorithm parameters** to explore different behaviors and security models

Detailed documentation and usage instructions for the ROS Encryption Tool can be found on project website..

**ROSET Java API**

For those interested in implementation-level details or deeper experimentation, the ROSET Java API is available on GitHub as a single .java file, allowing full control over the encryption.

* The API can be used to encrypt/decrypt both strings and binary data
* The Main .java file is provided with usage examples
* Full developer documentation is also available on the project site

To encrypt my message to Alice doesn't Signal have to send me her public key?  What stops them from sending me a fake public key?  I believe that at some point in the handshake process I probably sign something that validates my public key and she does the same.  But couldn't the server still just do the handshake with us itself- so trust is required for at least initial contact?

I'm asking this, because assuming that its true, would for example using a custom signal client that additionally encrypts with a derived key from a passphrase or something that was privately communicated improve security?  (Since you don't have to trust Signal servers alone on initial contact)"

Revocation was originally implemented using certificate revocation lists, but those are impractically large.  Then there is OCSP, but this has performance and privacy issues.  OCSP stapling can mitigate the privacy issues in TLS, but is somewhat brittle and often buggy.  OCSP services only work for when the parties are online (that's the O) at or near the time of connection, so they are suitable for TLS but not other applications such as connected cars.

Since 2017, researchers (including me) have been working on a solution called CRLite, which is basically to compress CRLs in a way that takes the unique properties of the revocation problem into account.  But until now, CRLite hasn't been quite good enough to reach broad deployment.  It was available under a feature flag in Firefox, but even with compression the CRLs were too large.

At Real World Crypto 2025, John Schanck announced that he has implemented a CRLite variant to be rolled out to Firefox, which is currently enabled by default in Desktop Firefox Nightly.  The new system uses a full compressed CRL every 22 days (currently 6.7 MB) plus small updates every 6 hours (currently 26.8 kB) to implement 93% of the certificate revocation checks on-device, thus avoiding those OCSP queries.  There is still some room for improvement in these sizes, both from better compression in Firefox (e.g. compression of the metadata using previous metadata as a hint) and better practices from CAs.

Most revocations are for lower-priority administrative reasons, so for mobile browsers a smaller set could be pushed with only high-priority revocations (key compromise, domain transferred, etc)."

Hi everyone!  

I want to start a virtual reading group focused on cryptography and number theory, where we can learn together in a collaborative environment. Whether you’re a beginner or have some background, all you need is curiosity! 

Currently I have physical copies of these books to start with:  
1. *Rational Points on Elliptic Curves* (Silverman & Tate)  
2. *An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography* (Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman) 

And have plans of reading *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves* by Silverman, later.

Topics We Could Explore:
- Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)  
- Lattice-based cryptography 
- Real-world implementations of number theory  
- Problem-solving sessions  

We could host it in a discord server and have discussion sessions in the voice channels. We could vote on other books and areas to study, and adjust as we go.  

**Who Should Join?**  
- Anyone interested in math-backed cryptography
- No prerequisites! We’ll start from the basics and help each other.  

If you’re interested:  
 **Comment or DM me** with:  
   - Your timezone + general availability 
   - Which book/topic you’d like to start with.

What should the server do in a TLS 1.3 handshake if it doesn't recognise the early data PSK?,9,1jmm147,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jmm147/what_should_the_server_do_in_a_tls_13_handshake/,4,2025-03-29 08:15:01,"I have a 0-RTT handshake as follows:

Client's perspective:

First flight:

The client pings off client hello, then uses the early keys to encrypt early data and end of early data application record. The encrypted records are all 'wrapped' and look like application records.

Second flight:

The client receives server hello and finds out that the pre\_shared\_key wasn't recognised by the server so it uses the server-supplied diffie hellman keys to generate and encrypt the client handshake finished record, also wrapped.

From the server perspective:

The server receives a client hello message and responds with a server hello not including the preshared key extension. The server then receives some number of records it can't decrypt followed by a client handshake finished record that it can decrypt.

What is the server meant to do here? Is it meant to attempt decryption of these wrapped application records using the handshake keys and then blindly discard anything it fails to decrypt? Once the server receives handshake finished, encrypted with the right keys, it can continue?

Or is the server meant to send an alert about records it can't decrypt?"
Asymmetric Data Encryption - Is reversing the role of keys interesting or valuable?,0,1jmteev,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jmteev/asymmetric_data_encryption_is_reversing_the_role/,34,2025-03-29 13:55:21,"I'm currently testing a new encryption algorithm that reverses the traditional concepts of asymmetric keys (like RSA/ECC).

For context, current asymmetric algorithms (RSA/ECC) are primarily used for symmetric key exchange or digital signatures. Like this:

* Public key: Encrypt-only, cannot decrypt or derive private key.
* Private key: Decrypts messages, easily derives the public key.

Due to inherent size limitations, RSA/ECC usually encrypt symmetric keys (for AES or similar) that are then used for encrypting the actual data.

My algorithm reverses the roles of the key pair, supporting asymmetric roles directly on arbitrary-size data:

* **Author key:** Symmetric in nature—can encrypt and decrypt data.
* **Reader key:** Derived from the producer key, can **only decrypt**, with no feasible way to reconstruct the producer key.

This design inherently supports data asymmetry at scale—no secondary tricks or tools needed.

I see these as potential use cases, but maybe this sub community sees others?

Potential practical use cases:

* Software licensing/distribution control
* Secure media streaming and broadcast
* Real-time secure communications
* Secure messaging apps
* DRM and confidential document protection
* Possibly cold-storage or large-scale secure archives

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on:

* Practical value for the listed use cases
* Security or cryptanalysis concerns
* General curiosity or skepticism around the concept

Is there any encryption algorithm that uses hashing?,0,1jkqsgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jkqsgi/is_there_any_encryption_algorithm_that_uses/,42,2025-03-26 19:04:14,"After looking at all major encryption algorithms, I've realized they all are somewhat complex given that the only thing they have to do is take a key and use it to ""mix"" all the information, beside authentication and efficiency.

I've thought of a simple system that would use pure hashing and XORing to encrypt the data (just an example for the question of the title):

1. Generate an initial hash with the password.
2. Divide the data to encrypt into N blocks.
3. Hash the initial hash recursively until you have N hashes of size(block).
4. Now, we take each hash block and each data block and XOR them together.
5. When done, put it all together, and that's the ciphered output.

To decrypt, it's more of the same.

I've not seen found any algorithms that do this or that explain why this is not secure. Using something like shake256 to generate hash blocks of 4KB, the efficiency is similar to other algos like AES.

I don't see a potential weakness because of the XOR's, since each block has its own (limited) entropy, based on the password, which must have high entropy to begin with, otherwise it's *as* insecure as other algos.

Edit:

>One reason your construction is not secure is that if someone ever recovers a plaintext/ciphertext pair, they can recover that hash block and then iterate it themselves and recover the rest of the key stream.

I think this shall not a major brick wall for this scheme, but it may be. A workaround for this:

To mitigate this, insert a one block of random data inside our input data, this is the random header. This works as a salt and as a ""key recovery problem"" solver, at the same time. This way no one can predict it, because it's data that exists nowhere else. But this is useless if we still use a cascade of recursive hashes, so:

We can mitigate it doing this: For each hash block, XOR it with the result of the last cipher block. The first will be XORed with the random header it is already XORed with the random header.

Tell me if this makes sense."

What do you think of my protocol design?,0,1jjlye4,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jjlye4/what_do_you_think_of_my_protocol_design/,7,2025-03-25 10:24:29,"This post mentions cryptocurrency, but is about the underlying design to secure these keys, not about the currency itself. It could be applied to any secrets.

I'm a developer, working in cryptocurrency space. I came across an NFC-based wallet ([Burner](https://burner.pro/)), and thought it would be fun to make a similar concept for my business cards. My version will only connect to the testnet with worthless assets, so it doesn't actually matter, but I still want to make it as secure as possible given the constraints. The IC they used ([Arx](https://arx.org)) is $25 a pop and supports on-device secp256k1 signing, whereas my version will use cheap NTag215 NFC stickers.

All crypto operations happen in user-space in the browser frontend. This is obviously insecure, and not suitable for real assets, but this is just for fun and an exercise in doing the best possible with the constraints of the hardware. While I work with crypto pretty frequently, it's generally at a higher level, so I'm curious if there are any huge holes in my concept:

Goals:

  * Assuming I retain all information written to the tags, I shouldn't be able to access the wallet private key (secp256k1)

  * Assuming the backend database is compromised, the wallet private keys must not be compromised

  * Assuming the backend API is compromised or MITM'd, the wallet private keys must not be compromised

  * Physical access to the NFC tag alone should not be sufficient to access the wallet private key

  * The wallet private key should be protected by a user-configurable PIN code (not hard-coded and changable)

Non-goals:

  * Compromises to the user's browser is out-of-scope. This includes malicious extensions, keyloggers etc

  * Compromises to the frontend application is out-of-scope. For example, inserting malicious code that sends the private key to a 3rd party after client-side decryption (in the same way if Signal's app was compromised it's game over regardless of the encryption). This could be mitigated technically by hosting the frontend HTML on IPFS, which is immutable.

  * Compromises of the underlying crypto libraries

  * Side-channel or other attacks during wallet key generation

Each NFC tag contains a URL to my site, like `http://wallet.me.com/1#<secret-payload>`

The hash portion of a URL is never sent to servers, it's only accessible on the client side. The secret payload contains several pieces of data to bootstrap the wallet:

* 32 byte random seed - **KEK seed**
* 32 byte Ed25519 private key - **tag signer**
* 8 byte random salt - **PIN salt**

The backend API is pre-configured with the corresponding Ed25519 public key for each wallet ID.

When the NFC tag is read, it opens the URL to the application which reads the payload and **wallet ID** from the URL.

**Fetch metadata**

Using the ID from the URL, the application makes an **unauthenticated** request to fetch wallet metadata. This returns a status key indicating whether the wallet has been set up.

**First-time setup**

If the wallet hasn't been set up yet, the application starts the setup:

1. User provides a 6 digit numeric PIN
2. The PIN is hashed with scrypt using the **PIN salt** to derive a 32 byte **baseKey**
3. An AES-GCM **KEK** is derived with PBKDF2 from the **baseKey** using the **KEK seed** as the salt
  * I'm not sure if this step is superflous - the **KEK seed** could also be used in step 2 instead of a dedicated PIN salt and the scrypt output used directly as the AES key?
4. A secpk256k1 **wallet key** key is randomly generated
5. The **wallet key** is encrypted with the **KEK**
6. A payload is constructed with the **wallet ID** and **encrypted wallet key**
7. The payload is signed by the **tag signer** to create the **tag signature**
8. The payload is signed by the **wallet key** to create the **wallet signature**
9. The payload is sent to the API along with the **tag signature** and **wallet signature**
10. The API verifies the **tag signature** using the pre-configured Ed25519 public key for the wallet ID
  * This step ensures the user is in possession of the card to set up the wallet
11. The API verifies the **wallet signature** and recovers the wallet public key and address
12. The API stores the **encrypted wallet key**, wallet public key and wallet address

**On subsequent access**

The metadata indicates the wallet has been set up.

The application uses the **tag signer** to construct a signed request to fetch encrypted wallet key material. This returns the **encrypted private key**, wallet public key and address.

1. The user provides their 6 digit PIN
2. The PIN is hashed and KEK derived the same as during setup
3. The **encrypted private key** is decrypted with the **KEK**
4. The wallet public key is derived from the decrypted private key, and compared with the known public key. If different, PIN is incorrect
5. The wallet is now unlocked

**Changing PIN**

Once the wallet has been unlocked, the user can also change the pin.

1. The new PIN is provided
2. A new KEK is derived, using the same hard-coded salt and seed
3. The private key is re-encrypted using the new KEK
4. A payload is constructed with the wallet ID and new encrypted private key
5. The payload is signed by the **tag signer** to create the **tag signature**
6. The payload is signed by the **wallet key** to create the **wallet signature**
7. The payload is sent to the API along with the **tag signature** and **wallet signature**
8. The API verifies the **tag signature** using the pre-configured Ed25519 public key for the wallet ID
9. The API verifies the **wallet signature** and recovers the wallet public key and address
10. The wallet public key is compared to the known public key from setup
  * This step is to verify that the wallet has been unlocked before changing PIN
11. The API updates the **encrypted wallet key**

The old draft RFC 8446 was explicit that this is not allowed. Was this removed to leave it open to implementations, or because it is implied forbidden because clients must signal support for extensions first?

Usually server extensions are in the EncryptedExtensions or the ServerHello records. Having one in the SessionTicket is a special case, so it's harder to infer what the rules here are.

I'm noticing that clients that support early data (e.g. \`openssl s\_client\` and Firefox (but intermittently)),  don't send this hello extension on the first connection, but will happily use 0-RTT on a 0-RTT-enabled session ticket. So there is a clear advantage in using the extension anyway if I am allowed to?"

ClientHandshakeFinished indicates the client has finished sending early application data records. ClientHandshakeFinished contains the hash of ServerHandshakeFinished. EncryptedExtensions is ordered before ServerHandshakeFinished. The server indicates in EncryptedExtensions whether it wishes to accept or reject the early data, based on an application layer callback (e.g. accept GET, reject POST).

This introduces a cyclic dependency. The server must indicate whether it wishes to accept early data before the client can signal that it has finished sending early data.

How does this cycle get resolved?"
Lost after PhD in Cryptography,37,1jgcxc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jgcxc5/lost_after_phd_in_cryptography/,3,2025-03-21 04:34:36,"I recently got a PhD in cryptography focusing on secure messaging. I managed to publish 3 papers in the process by heavily collaborating with other people and my supervisor but I feel completely lost thinking what to do because I don't really feel like I gained enough experience or knowledge to conduct proper research on my own. I am barely able to come up with proper security definitions and the security proofs we do, but I can do them with enough help. Both game based or UC security proofs still seem like a very hard task. I don't mind crushing myself on some hard task but what I mean is mostly about me not enjoying any part of it.

I used to be good at implementing stuff but I also got quite rusty about those skills during the last 4 years. In my last year, I wanted to get into zero-knowledge proofs but was bombarded with bunch of literature on snarks etc. I feel quite overwhelmed by the number of papers on eprint each week and I don't have any motivation to read any of them. Mainly becasue it always feels like a follow up research will pop up from an expert in the topic by the time I start thinking of a research problem. 

I have the following two questions: 

1) How does one start developing skills to finish a paper from start to end? Especially, how does one pick a problem such that there is enough time to work on it until someone smarter or with large research group solves it? I am willing to switch to a new cryptography subfield as well (maybe with less game based proofs).

2) Should I just quit research and maybe pursue cryptography engineering? Would appreciate any perspective/suggestions for this transition."

If you think that a certain non-NIST standard cryptosystem is worth studying why so? For example, where is the non-standard cryptosystem used in production or an impactful project?

What cryptosystems have you seen submitted to NIST competitions that you deemed worth studying despite being rejected by the NIST?"

The Problem with the Advice: Don't Roll Your Own Crypto,0,1j9xdyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1j9xdyp/the_problem_with_the_advice_dont_roll_your_own/,19,2025-03-12 17:58:02,"One of my concerns with modern cryptography is that people are violating the sage advice ""Don't Roll Your Own Crypto(graphy)\[sic\])"".

Machines are only getting smaller and sometimes such machines don't have the system resources to use off-the-shelf de facto crypto libraries such as OpenSSL. What I learned from security conferences so far is that companies in the embedded and IoT sector are simply rolling their own crypto (incorrectly) due to a lack of option. So the classic advice to not roll your own crypto is not working from a business standpoint.

There is no sign the Embedded & IoT sector is going to stop as long as it is profitable. It seems in the future we should expect miscoded crypto to cause problems for people that have to rely on embedded & IoT devices in the future for these reasons."

However, the truth is Grover's Algorithm still reduces the bit security of passwords effectively by half. If I use a password with 128 bits of security Grover's Algorithm would reduce the bit security to 64 bits, which is weak. I am bringing this up because few people have the diligence to use strong passwords that would survive Grover's Algorithm and I suspect this will be a widespread problem in the future where passwords once held strong against classical machines are rendered weak against quantum supercomputers."

Over a year ago, I worked on my thesis on Visual Secret Sharing (VSS). While I’m not a mathematician, I read a ton of papers on Visual Cryptography and Random Grids, implementing various schemes just to generate images for my thesis.

Rather than letting all that code go to waste, I turned it into a Python toolkit with a web interface to make these techniques more accessible. This project allows you to experiment with VSS schemes easily. If you’re interested in image-based cryptography or want to contribute new schemes, feel free to check out the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/coduri/VisualCrypto](https://github.com/coduri/VisualCrypto)

*If you’ve never heard of VSS, it’s a technique where, instead of using a key to encrypt an image, the image is divided into two or more shares. Individually, these shares reveal no information about the original image (the secret), but when combined, they reconstruct it.*

I’ve also written an introduction to VSS in the tool’s documentation. If you’re curious, you can check it out here: [https://coduri.github.io/VisualCrypto/pages/introductionVSS/](https://coduri.github.io/VisualCrypto/pages/introductionVSS/)

This project is still in its early stages, and I’d love to collaborate with anyone interested in **expanding VSS schemes, optimizing performance, or improving the UI**. Whether you’d like to contribute code, share ideas, or test the tool, any help is greatly appreciated!"

I've been to a few cyber conferences of recent and all the talk is primarily - almost exclusively - about PQC.

My understanding is that QC will require 1000s of qubits (some say at min 4k, other same much more) before RSA is broken.  However, it seems we're only in the few to 100s of qubits right now.

Then, there's the topological materials for QC and that seems like it could accelerate things...if the hype is true.

In contrast, i hear NO discussions anywhere about the threat of AI cryptanalysis.  It's my opinion that AI-C is here now and is more likely a serious threat than QC is.   Further, there's likely to be a huge benefit for AI using QC, when QC stabilizes, and AI can leverage it.

So, am I just imagining that AI is a threat?

As this is a university project, I am not aiming for overly complex optimizations. However, I am interested in achieving even small optimizations where possible.

while there are several bug-fixes in the p2p file-transfer project, the codebase is largely the same. both projects are source-code-available because they are webapps. its important to note that while the ""chat"" project is presented as unminified code, ""file"" is presented as minified and obfuscated code (as close-sourced as i can make it?). claiming the ""codebase is largely the same"" becomes more meaningless/unverifyable after this process."

Is understanding the basics enough - if yes, what would constitute basics in a typical book on Coding Theory (I need to look for the right book also).

**EDIT:** For e.g. to understand Pre-Quantum Elliptic Curve Cryptography, I don't need to know deep algebraic geometry - just the basics are enough - I don't need to know Affine Varieties, Isogenies, Riemann–Roch, Divisors, Weil Conjectures etc as long as I am not planning to design something new based on ECs.

NIST STS questions and use with encrypted data,7,1istg90,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1istg90/nist_sts_questions_and_use_with_encrypted_data/,17,2025-02-18 19:34:34,"**Hello cryptos.**

I'm testing output of an encryption algorithm and would like to know if a test collection of STS results of a very high quantity will be meaningful.

My test plan that I'm running right now...

1. Creation of 803 cleartext samples across 7 groups:
   * **RepetitivePatterns**
      * These are things like repeating bytes, repeating tuple and triples, repeating short ordered sequences, and so on.
      * The patterns are of increasing sizes from around 511 bytes to just over 4MB.
   * **LowEntropy**
      * These are cleartext samples that have only a few available bytes in total to distribute.
      * Some samples are just random orders and others are cases where the few bytes are separated by large runs of another like: `AnnnnnnnBnnnCnnnnnnnnBnnnnnnC`
   * **NaturalLanguage**
      * These are randomly constructed English language sentences and paragraphs.
      * Of varying lengths, varying sentences per paragraph, and varying quantity of paragraphs.
   * **RandomData**
      * Varying lengths of random bytes from a CSRNG.
   * **PreCompressed**
      * Using the same construction from NaturalLanguage, Brotli compress the data and use that as cleartext samples.
      * Also of varying lengths.
   * **BinaryExe**
      * Enumerate files from the local file system for DLL/EXE files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Windows\System32` and subfolders.
   * **Structured**
      * Enumerate XML/HTML/JSON/RTF/CSV files between 3K and 6MB.
      * Currently produces 72 files on my host from `C:\Program Files` and subfolders.
2. For each cleartext, encrypt and append the output (without padding) to a file. 
3. Run ENT for the file as well as STS. STS params are: 2 million bits length and 100 streams, enabling all tests (takes about 9-12 mins per file). 
4. Record the results in a DB.

**Am I misinterpreting the value of STS for analyzing encrypted data?**  
**Will I gain any useful insights by this plan?**

I've run it for about 24 hours so far and have done over **9 million encrypts** and over **1100 STS executions**.  
Completion will be just over **3000 runs** and near **20 million encrypts**.

For any that are curious, I created a sandbox that uses the same encryption here:  [https://bllnbit.com](https://bllnbit.com)

Should the rendezvous server be trusted?Cannot the relay server  brute force them offline?

You could prove the inputs for each iteration of the loop outputs the inputs for the next iteration of the loop. This is highly parallelisable and the polynomials involved would be tiny making inversion steps much simpler.

You would then need some way to succinctly aggregate all those mini proofs.

Is this pure silliness or might there be something here?

Request for good resources discussing the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocol engineering,9,1ihll6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1ihll6q/request_for_good_resources_discussing_the/,2,2025-02-04 10:26:08,"**tl;dr Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of the use of time as a primitive in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

Recently I've been reviewing some cryptographic protocols that heavily rely on time and time windows in the negotiation of long term cryptographic artifacts or short term sessions.  The details aren't necessarily important but this particular protocol hinges on the assumption that Alice and Bob have synchronized their host times to a network time server, with Bob's host time being crucial to the whole scheme on whether or not he accepts Alice's signature.  While a single session isn't so bad when there are multiple Alice's in some kind of multi-sig scheme replay attacks become much harder to reason about within this constraint.

However, I've dealt with a lot of distributed time issues in my career like: ( [https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca) ) and ""time"" as a concept is one that I don't entirely trust (especially in a security protocol) as its pretty nebulous, even for protocols (like GPS) that rely on it extensively.  You've got to go to great lengths in resources in order to manage its discrepancies.  I also am familiar with the history of constant time programming and all the mitigations we use for potential replay attacks so I know this is probably one of the trickier areas of implementation in the real world.

So that's a long lead-in to my request for resources: **Are there any good papers, books, discussions online that focus on the meta-problems of using time in cryptographic protocols and various options protocol engineers use to mitigate them?**

I am certain everyone here agrees this is not best.

However, I also noticed that although there are certain source-available commercial cryptographic libraries they allow businesses to integrate their code into a proprietary code base.

This is what companies such as [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/) does.

However on this subreddit people such as Scott Contini admitted one of the biggest issues with cryptographic libraries aren't the design and implementation themselves--its the fact that people misuse them. Software and security engineers routinely mess up making API calls to cryptographic libraries when developing cryptographic protocols/applications. Cryptographic Failures is the [OWASP Top #2](https://owasp.org/Top10/).

So what I am saying is I think it is just as important for businesses to release the code that uses cryptographic software in any shape or form to the public as much as businesses should make the cryptographic software library implementation available to the public for scrutiny.

What are your thoughts on this?"

Also from some shallow reading you can compress the public key to half the size (32-bytes) by only using one of the (x, y) coordinates due to ""special properties of the curve"". So then how would I find the probabilty of a random 32-byte stream being a valid EC public key on the (secp256k1) curve? Does the probability remain the same?"

It then says that:

I am dealing with a kind of cryptolocker situation... Not \_that\_ bad, but kinda bad.

Data that is encrypted out of my reach: \~8 years of Signal Desktop data (including family photos and much else).

How it went beyond reach: In late 2024, Signal Desktop started encrypting its data encryption key using DPAPI. Then, in early 2025, my laptop died. While I have a full file system backup (thank you backblaze!), the old SSD is damaged and dead (I currently have it in an M.2->USB enclosure, imaging apps like Macrium and Acronis fail to image it, repairs like fdisk are not able to fully repair the volume).

IOW: The old Windows OS is not bootable. (If it were, I would be able to use [this tool ](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/blob/master/desktopdatabase/getkeyfromencrypted_win.cc)to decrypt the Signal crypto key)

The crypto path is:

(a) Signal Data Encryption key -> (b) Itself encrypted via DPAPI under OldPC -> (c) WinUser1

The puzzle I am trying to solve is (b)

I have dug around the DPAPI world.. My specific context is: OldPC was Win11 but WinUser1 is an ""old style"" Windows user \[e.g. not a [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com) account\] \_and\_ I know the Windows Password for that user \[as that user was yours truly\].

Ideally, there would be an offline DPAPI tool or cracker. I can give it (b) and the Windows Password for (c). I can also provide the raw registry files or other files from the old Windows OS (or potentially extract values from those files).

Is there a possible path forward?"
The official AES test vectors look incorrect,11,1i7dupc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1i7dupc/the_official_aes_test_vectors_look_incorrect/,7,2025-01-22 09:36:52,"No way they can be, right? _(Edit: see comments, problem was between chair and keyboard. Thanks!)_

I'm currently writing yet another AES implementation. My goal is to have a bitslice implementation, similar to BearSSL, but with a nicer API. Anyway, right now I'm making a simple, slow, unsafe (variable time) reference implementation, to better understand AES before I do the actual bitslice. So far AES ECB encryption seems to be working, at least according to [this nice online tool](https://legacy.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step).

It was time for a more serious test suite, so I searched for official test vectors. I landed on [this page](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Block-Ciphers), and eventually downloaded [these response files](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip). In those I extracted the `ECBMCT128.rsp`, wrote a parser, and ran my implementation against it.

It does not work.

Specifically, the very first test got me this:

    KEY       : 139a35422f1d61de3c91787fe0507afd
    PLAINTEXT : b9145a768b7dc489a096b546f43b231f

    RESULT    : 0da1b56ba11c1a5500e95583c0eac913

The first 3 lines come from the response file, and the RESULT is what my implementation outputs — it's supposed to match the CIPHERTEXT. They're clearly different, so I guess I botched it. No problem, let's try the online tool I was using before, see what _their_ result is:

    0da1b56b a11c1a55 00e95583 c0eac913

Okay now I'm confused. The online tool agrees with me. The official test vectors do not. What the hell is going on? Was the stuff I downloaded not official? Did I use the wrong file? Does AES ECB involve more than just using the raw output of the block cipher? Are the test vectors made for a row-major implementation of AES instead of column major like the specs say?

Where does the difference come from? And also, where can I find a reputable source of test vectors?"

I am wondering for any information on the security of SHA3 and its sponge function versus older hash functions like MD5, SHA1, SHA2.

What makes it more secure? How heavily studied has it been. The sponge function is still newer than the other constructions but its internal state is quite large.

I am looking for hash functions with good security margins.

BLAKE2 and SHA3 are so far the best looking but is there any reason I should look at SHA2 again because it’s well studied.

I would like to engage in a thorough discussion comparing these hash functions."

"CommunisP – A Time-Ratcheted P2P E2EE Messenger, self-hosted from the browser.
",0,1i32cos,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1i32cos/communisp_a_timeratcheted_p2p_e2ee_messenger/,17,2025-01-16 17:19:45,"*A quiet revolution in secure communication*

In a digital world dominated by centralized services—where messages, metadata, and personal data often funnel through corporate servers—**CommunisP** emerges as a beacon of true privacy and user empowerment. We’re not just another “secure messenger”; we’re a **movement** dedicated to reshaping how communication works. By blending advanced cryptographic techniques with a **decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**, [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/) offers unrivaled confidentiality, ensuring your conversations remain exclusively yours.

# 

# No Central Logs, No Big Data Harvest

Imagine someone demanding your chat histories... and you literally have **nothing** centralized to produce. Many “private” messengers still route every message through their own servers or store them in some buffer. CommunisP instead enables **direct, encrypted P2P channels**, leaving no archives or metadata in a big corporate database. Even under subpoena, there’s no lingering trove to expose.

# 

* **No Phone Numbers or Emails**: A simple nickname + password is all you need.
* **No Single Authority**: Without a central server, no entity can be coerced into handing over your data.
* **Minimal Metadata**: “Ping” notifications remotely inform you that someone wants to connect or of messages received from your home browser—without revealing message content or personal info.
* **Off-Limits**: Because everything is handled in real time, ephemeral encryption means once a conversation ends, it **truly** ends.

# The Problem with Centralized Communication

* **Privacy Risks**: Central servers are prime targets for data breaches.
* **Censorship & Control**: A single authority can monitor or suppress content.
* **Data Commodification**: Personal data is often mined for profit.
* **Single Point of Failure**: Server outages immediately paralyze entire userbases.

These inherent issues underscore the need for a platform that values user **rights** and **freedoms** over corporate convenience.

# Our Philosophy: Decentralization & Empowerment

1. **Users Own Their Data**: You decide if ephemeral messages stay ephemeral or are saved to local logs. No one else sees them.
2. **Privacy is Paramount**: End-to-end encryption ensures only intended recipients see the conversation.
3. **No Central Authority**: CommunisP eliminates data silos and corporate middlemen.

# Decentralization as a Core Principle

* **Enhanced Security**: Fewer infiltration points for attackers.
* **Resilience**: If some devices go offline, the rest keep the network alive.
* **Democratized Access**: Limited central power to manipulate or throttle communication.

# The CommunisP Approach

**1. Browser-as-Server / Always-On Presence**

Rather than forcing you to install Docker containers or rent a VPS, **your normal web browser** (on a home PC) functions as a 24/7 node:

* **No Extra Setup**: Just open [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), log in, and let the tab run.
* **Offline Message Storage**: If your phone is switched off, your desktop browser quietly receives (and optionally logs) new messages.
* **Retrieval On Your Terms**: When you reconnect from another device or location, you can seamlessly fetch logs or continue chats.

**2. W Ratchet Encryption**

CommunisP’s signature security layer merges **time-based ephemeral key rotation** with **per-message ephemeral expansions**:

* **Session Key Rotations Every 60 Seconds**: Ensuring even if a key is compromised, it’s worthless by the next minute.
* **Unique Ephemeral Keys per Message**: Each message is independently encrypted, insulating the rest if one key is somehow exposed.
* **Forward Secrecy & Post-Compromise Security**: Attackers can’t retroactively decrypt old messages or read future ones after a key leak—because ephemeral keys shift so frequently.

**3. Ephemeral Local Logs (Optional)**

* **Local Only**: If you enable “Local Message Logs,” ephemeral messages are stored solely on your home browser. No central copies exist.
* **Nickname Authentication**: Only a device logged in with your nickname can request or clear these logs, and this can also require an additional 'passphrase'.
* **Truly Ephemeral**: If you prefer no trace at all, keep logging disabled or send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command to wipe everything.

# Why CommunisP Is Different

* **No Central Storage**: End-to-end encryption prevents even CommunisP’s minimal servers from reading your messages. They only help peers find each other (signaling).
* **Time + Message Ratchet**: Beyond typical single-lane E2EE, we tie ephemeral expansions to both message-by-message and minute-by-minute intervals, shrinking the adversary’s window.
* **Offline Resilience**: Your home browser is your “personal server,” so friends can reach you anytime, even if your phone or other devices are offline.
* **User-Level Control**: You alone decide whether ephemeral messages persist or vanish, free from corporate retention policies.

# Technical Underpinnings (Quick Highlights)

1. **WebRTC**
   * Circumvents NAT/firewalls via STUN on port 3478.
   * Provides real-time P2P data channels for messages/files.
   * Encrypted transport at the network layer.
2. **ECDH + ECDSA**
   * Derives shared secrets without exposing private keys.
   * Ensures authenticity of messages (ECDSA digital signatures).
3. **AES-GCM**
   * Authenticated, high-speed encryption.
   * Protects confidentiality and detects tampering.
4. **W Ratchet**
   * Time-driven session key resets every 60 seconds.
   * Per-message ephemeral expansions with HKDF or ephemeral ECDH.
   * Eliminates static or long-lived encryption contexts.
5. **Offline/Async Support**
   * A browser left open at home acts as a 24/7 relay, gathering ephemeral messages so that you can fetch them later from any device.

# Typical Usage Scenarios

* **Activists & Whistleblowers**: Communicate off-grid, no centralized logs, no phone number requirement.
* **Personal Chat & File-Sharing**: Freed from phone-based constraints, you can share ephemeral files with advanced encryption.
* **Work Collaboration**: If compliance or security rules forbid storing data in corporate servers, CommunisP’s ephemeral approach is perfect—nothing official to subpoena.
* **Everyday Privacy**: Just want to keep a private chat private? No big deal—CommunisP is here.

# Practical Workflow Example

1. **Morning**
   * Open your home browser, log in to CommunisP, keep that tab open.
2. **You’re Away**
   * Your phone is off or you’re not using it.
   * Friends or colleagues message your nickname; your home browser collects any new ephemeral messages.
3. **Return & Retrieve**
   * On your phone or another PC, log in with the same nickname.
   * If you want to see offline logs, send a special ephemeral passphrase. The home browser confirms your identity, encrypts the logs, and sends them to you P2P.
4. **Continue Chat**
   * Chat in real time using ephemeral keys that rotate every minute, ensuring fresh security.
5. **Optionally Clear**
   * If you want to maintain absolute ephemerality, send a “Clear\*” ephemeral command, erasing any local logs on your home browser.

# The Quiet Revolution

>

* **Truly Off-Grid**: Past a minimal handshake, your message content never returns to a central server—**ever**.
* **Off-Limits**: No corporate or third-party entity has any read or moderation ability over your conversation.
* **User Empowerment**: Zero overhead, zero forced phone IDs, zero illusions of “secure” while data is still being mined.

**CommunisP** stands for a new age of private communication—**where you alone decide** what’s stored, who sees it, and how ephemeral it stays.

# 

**CommunisP** is more than a messenger. It’s a **quiet revolution** in how we exchange data online. By seamlessly combining:

* **Browser-as-Server** convenience,
* **W Ratchet** ephemeral encryption, and
* **Full P2P architecture**

We deliver a system that’s off-grid, off-limits, and in **your** hands. No phone numbers, no corporate synergy—just encryption, ephemeral privacy, and your personal freedom.

If you’re ready to **transcend old paradigms** of data-harvesting and central surveillance, visit [CommunisP.com](https://communisp.com/), open a tab, pick a nickname, and step into the next frontier of user-driven, cryptographically robust communication."

Say that the the public parameters is (A, u) = (A, s\^t A + e) with A matrix, s the secret key, e an error.

I see that in the original paper as well as in follow up papers, the encryption part of the system is of the form (A\*r, u\*r + m\*q/2)

However in the following talk at the timestamp in chris peikert's talk, the encryption is of the form (A\*r **+ e**, r\*u + m\*q/2): [https://youtu.be/K\_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097](https://youtu.be/K_fNK04yG4o?list=PLgKuh-lKre10rqiTYqJi6P4UlBRMQtPn0&t=2097)

Looking more into it, i see another paper in which he defines an improved scheme supposed to generalize 3 former iterations of the scheme. All of the older schemes are of the first form, while the proposed scheme is of the 2nd. it's in chapter 3. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/613.pdf)

My question is: what gives? am i looking at papers that are out of date? when someone mentions regev without specifying, will they be thinking of an encryption of the first or second form? What does it change in fine? Is it just that adding an error with one error distribution is equivalent to adding none but selecting r with another distribution?

  
edit: I also noticed that in ringLWE and moduleLWE, the latter showed up, not the first form"

Can you go the other way? Choose an elliptic curve over a small (~ 2^24 ) finite field with a fairly large embedding degree (~ 125). Then present adversaries with a large (2^(24*125) ) finite field Diffie Hellman protocol, which you then map back to the small curve for which discrete log is easy?

Bulletproofs Question: How does it prove both a proof of knowledge of the vectors and also the innerproduct?,16,1hwf370,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1hwf370/bulletproofs_question_how_does_it_prove_both_a/,2,2025-01-08 02:13:45,"This is about the Bulletproofs zk Proof protocol - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf

(I am going to use additive notation instead of the multiplicative notation used in the paper to describe my question)

Prover knows 2 vectors **a** & **b** such that their inner product is c. 

She creates a binding (but not hiding) Pedersen commitment to the 2 vectors 

P = **aG** + **bH**

(Here **G** & **H** are 2 vectors of generators - the relations between the different generators both inside each vector of generators & also between the 2 set of generators is not known).

assuming **a** = [a1, a2, a3] & **G** = [G1, G2, G3] etc, this commitment will look like

P = a1G1 + a2G2 + a3G3 + b1H1 + b2H2 + b3G3

which we write as 


P = **aG** + **bH**

c = <**a**, **b**>

The Prover sends P & c to the verifier.
The verifier samples a random x and sends it to the prover

There is another generator V (the relations between V & **G** & **H** is not known)

Verifier constructs another a new point 

P' = P + cxV

Let xV = U 

The prover proves

P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U

using the Bulletproofs Protocol

- I understand the protocol.
- I also understand why the random x is required - i.e. how the prover can prove a wrong c' in place of c if the proof had just proved P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>V instead of P' = **aG** + **bH** + <a,b>U 

What I don't understand is how this one proof proves 2 things

- Proof of knowledge of 2 vectors
- Proof that c is the inner product of the 2 vectors

How does proving the longer statement prove the 2 things?

I mean proving A + B = C + D doesn't prove A = C & B = D, so how does it work here?

------------------------

I have my own explanation of why this works but I am not sure if it's correct


For e.g. in many zkProofs let's say we have to prove 3 polynomials to be zero polynomials using the Schwartz Zippel Lemma, we combine them using a linearly independent set.

i.e. if prover wants to prove 3 polynomials f1, f2 & f3 are zero, then instead of proving it using 3 separate Schwartz Zippel proofs, she can combine them into one polynomial.

The Verifier sends a random r. Prover creates a linearly independent set [r^0, r^1, r^2] & then creates a new polynomial 

f = f1 + r.f2 + r^(2).f3

Now when f is evaluated at another random point send by the verif & the evaluation is zero, then that proves f1, f2 & f3 are all zero?

is something similar being done here - i.e. the 2 statements are being combined using [x^0 , x^(1)] & hence it proves both statements are true? I am not fully convinced because this isn't a polynomial & nor is Schwarz Zeppel being used here."

I want to use libsodium in PHP in a little code signing/verifying library I'm writing.  I had a working implementation in OpenSSL, but that extension isn't always installed on hosts, where it seems that libsodium mostly is.

The API seems pretty straightforward, with one exception - how does one safely store the private key on disk?  With Openssl, I was using a user entered passphrase to encrypt the private key.  That meant if the key was stolen from the disk, it would be useless without the passphrase.  When using the key to sign ZIP files, the user was also prompted to enter the key to get access to the private key.  I felt pretty safe that way, given how insecure some shared hosting providers are.

I don't seem a simple way to do the same thing with sodium. You can create a private/public key, but at that point you can't easily encrypt it , not without OpenSSL I don't think.  The same seems to be with saving it to disk - it seems I can save it was binary data, but not in any portable key format. Can anyone recommend a portable way to do this safely?  Thanks."
The best visual representations of elliptic curves on finite fields you are aware of,10,1hmqnoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1hmqnoj/the_best_visual_representations_of_elliptic/,12,2024-12-26 09:31:37,"Hi guys, in few words: my head wraps around visual representations way way way easier than math math models and watching visual presentations (better if they are interactive) makes my knowledge more flexible.

I'm aware of the representation of the curve on the Real filed, it is very clear of course, the geometric pointadd and pointdouble is so easy to visualize.

I'm aware of the classical grid representation on the finite field as well, not very useful to be honest.

I'm aware of the torus representation, very cool, I should look more into it (is it on the finite field by the way?)

I saw a youtube short that was showing with a terrible video resolution how the curve on the Real field was ""wrapped"" and ""cut"" to make it fit in the finite field grid, however the video had no information about that at all and everything was about the torus representation (which if I'm not wrong is just the finite field grid bended to shape a donut(?)), I would like to know more about this ""cut"" representation.

I heard about some polar-coordinate representation(?), what is that and how can I find something about it? (searching for polar representation of jacobian coordinates doesn't show me any visual representation).

I will work on a simple visual 3d representation that highlights how the different triplets of point are one the double of the other, the other the half of the one, etc.

Are you guys aware of some other interesting visual representation that are worth it?

**1. Choosing an algorithm and parameters**

I have components in rust, android/kotlin and ios/<probably swift?> and I need a hashing algorithm that's consistent and secure across all 3 systems. This means I need to be explicit in my choice of algorithm and parameters. Speed is almost not a consideration but security (not reversable and lack of known conflict attacks etc, so e.g. SHA1 is out) is. What's the current recommendation here?

**2. Choosing words**

I need to reduce a big value space into a much smaller value space, what's the proper way of doing this? To be more specific I have a number of factors I want to include in a hash, and then use the resulting hash to select words in a dictionary.

Currently my best thought is that the number of words in a dictionary can be represented in far fewer bits (\~20) bits than the full hash value (e.g 256), so by taking the first 20 bits and that selects the first word, second 20 bits is the second word etc.

Are there any standard actually proper ways of doing something like this?"

the embedding degree k is even, and the order of pairing is a prime r.
Put m:=k/2.
You must obtain the collect value of h_{p^m+1,A}(Q)
(where both A and Q are of order r).
But h_{r,A}(Q) have only to be precise up to (p^m+1)/r th root of the unity.
That is, instead of the correct value z, the value zu where
u^{(p^m+1)/r}=1 will do. This is because u is eliminated in the process
to obtain h_{p^m+1,A}(Q) from h_{r,A}(Q).

Feasability of cracking a non-CS PRNG when the output is reduced to a small set of characters.,2,1hd97ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1hd97ur/feasability_of_cracking_a_noncs_prng_when_the/,8,2024-12-13 04:14:59,"I'm looking for resources.

Predicting the future (or past) output of a regular PRNG from observations is very common, no issue with that.

But a case I see a lot in practice is people using PRNGs to create temporary codes or passwords by choosing a character at random from a limited set. I know that this should be vulnerable in theory, but I haven't seen it in practice and I can't find any research specifically tackling that case (my searching skills must be in cause). I expect the exact approach to differ based on the specific PRNG used, but I'm sure there are common ideas to these problems.

Does anyone has a paper or blog post lying around that deals with this? Or am I missing something obvious that makes the topic unworthy of getting its own research?

Recently I was reading the OG paper from Shamir and Biham regarding the attack and I am lost about of the details:

If we craft pairs that are special and supposed to fit the 13-round characteristic starting at round 2, we deal only with 2\^13 plaintexts with their cross product creating 2\^24 pairs. These have 2\^12 possible results, since we are interested in matching our given P' to cancel out F(R). F is the round function and R is the right 32 bit in the 1st round.

Now, they argue that because each ""structure"" (still not sure what they mean) contains 2\^12 pairs, we get that on average we'll need \~2\^35 pairs in order to get a ""right"" pair.

1. I don't understand the trick here, obviously there is one.  
2. I don't understand why we still need 2\^47 chosen plaintexts and similar running time? (The paper actually states 2\^36 running time, but wikipedia says something like 2\^47)

I am sure I don't understand all too, well, so correct my assumption if needed.

Is the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem well understood by the cryptographic community?,19,1h5sn7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1h5sn7a/is_the_nonabelian_hidden_subgroup_problem_well/,7,2024-12-03 11:20:44,"I've mentioned it to people and they look at me like I have three heads or something. The setup involves group G, and a non-commuting subgroup H, where H≤G. This naturally aligns with random matrices as matrix multiplication is order dependent.  Let's say we have public matrix A and hidden matrix U, AU ≠ UA and we can extend this to t'=AUx ≠ t=UAx. Then we can we have group G that comprises all t' and t elements in both AUx and UAx. 

The group operation is matrix multiplication, and subgroup UAx is H. Half of the complexity comes from the inability to distinguish elements in H from elements in G in general. Next we include some kind of hiding function f() that creates equivalence classes  out of the elements in G. This hiding function defines and maps cosets from both to the same output. 

This problem, when properly instantiated, very hard to solve as an adversary attempting to invert f() gets a result with no way to distinguish if came from a coset under H or under G, it is indistinguishable. 

Does any of this ring a bell with the cryptographic community or is this something only quantum researchers are working on? I'm trying to calibrate how I speak about this construction to cryptographers.

Making CTR mode commiting,8,1h2v850,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1h2v850/making_ctr_mode_commiting/,3,2024-11-29 14:37:21,"CTR mode and it's derivatives(like GCM) has an issue with key commitment. An attacker can convince a user to decrypt a given plaintext under multiple keys. For CTR mode, this is trivial since CTR mode provides no authentication at all. For modes that use a polynomial hash to provide authenticated encryption functionality like GCM, there exists attacks that allow an attacker to generate multiple keys for a given nonce-ciphertext-tag tuple.

I believe there is a simple countermeasure that ensures key commitment. The modification required is simple. We simply output the first block of the CTR mode during encryption and prepend it to the ciphertext. During decryption, we verify that the first block of the ciphertext matches the first output block of CTR mode. If this block matches, we proceed with decryption(or authentication and then decryption for modes like GCM).

My question is the following: Does this modification actually add key commitment and prevent invisible salamander attacks? My intuition for this property is that the CTR mode variant doesn't quite get to a complete proof(treating the block cipher as a PRF doesn't mean much since the attacker gets to control the key to said PRF, we'd need to model the block cipher as a random oracle instead). However, this might be provably secure for the AEAD mode variants like GCM or CTR+Poly-1305.

PS: This can also be used for Salsa/ChaCha20 as well. In that case we can just skip the step where we convert the ""block cipher"" from a PRP into a PRF because the stream cipher itself is effectively a keyed PRF."

Scheme for long lived auth,5,1gyrf3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gyrf3n/scheme_for_long_lived_auth/,2,2024-11-24 07:51:51,"I'm working on a new product that will have mobile phone apps as some clients, but due to timeliness and usage patterns I want long term auth of some kind. A refresh once per quarter or so would be ideal.

I could use JWT into this with a 3 month refresh token, but with a flaky network that would take two requests and that could be two slow. I could use JWT with a 3 month long access token, but that feels like crowbaring JWT into being something it's not meant to be. What I've seen previously is access token lifetimes of 2 hours or so.

I've been pondering some sort of api keys, signed key blobs sent with the request etc. But then I realized that maybe there's already a proper scheme for my use case before I go sketching out something...**drumwhirl**...sketchy.

So, to be concrete, I'm wondering if there's a scheme fitting these requirements:

1. Refresh / re-auth preferably once per quarter.
2. No refresh-request, has to work with just one request.

Feel free to ask for more details if it'll help, I'm still trying to figure them out myself. Otherwise, anyone got suggestions?"

Can a digital signature on some data be replaced?,2,1gwfm17,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gwfm17/can_a_digital_signature_on_some_data_be_replaced/,25,2024-11-21 06:55:30,"I am going to ask a rather stupid question for which I apologize in advance, but I'm sort of losing my head at this point.

I am working on an encryption system where two parties are required to authenticate themselves to one another and subsequently perform a key exchange.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Assume Alice and Bob both generate a secret one-time token.
2. Alice generates an ephemeral key pair and signs the token with her private key.
3. Alice sends the signature over to Bob along with her public key.
4. Bob verifies the signature and can now trust Alice's public key.

Now let's say a malicious actor, Charlie wants to authenticate his public key to Bob, and Charlie has managed to intercept the signature sent by Alice.

Can Charlie destroy Alice's original signature, sign the token with his own key, and ""replay"" it to Bob?

If this is possible, how can one avoid such a situation?

Edit: So it turns out there's a term for exactly what I was trying to achieve, called PAKE. Thanks to u/cryptoam1, u/Natanael_L, and u/djao for pointing it out, and sorry for asking a question without first doing thorough research, but I ended up learning something new. Reddit goated as always!"
Candidate for simple CSPRNG/ultra-lightweight stream cipher,4,1gw6h5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gw6h5o/candidate_for_simple_csprngultralightweight/,21,2024-11-20 21:12:36,"Hello everyone. Some time ago I created efficient pseudo-random number generators based on Collatz-like functions:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl\_generators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RNG/comments/19a2q24/collatzweyl_generators/)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17043)

One of the simplest of them is the Collatz-Weyl generator:

    static __uint128_t x, weyl, s; // s must be odd
    
    bool Collatz_Weyl(void){
      if(x % 2 == 1){
      x = (3*x+1)/2;}
      else{
      x = x/2;}
      x ^= (weyl += s);
    
      return x & 1;
    }

We can consider `s` as a key and the resulting single bit could be used as a cryptographically secure bit to XOR with plaintext, as in a typical strem cipher. Every iteration of presented function generate only 1 bit, similar to Blum Blum Shub. It can be used as a extremely light-weight stream cipher, the whole code is just (constant-time implementation):

    x = (-(x & 1) & (x + ((x + 1) >> 1)) | ~-(x & 1) & (x >> 1)) ^ (weyl += s);
    return x & 1;

In the linked thread I provide a certain method of attack, when XORation with weyl sequence is replaced by addition (toy version), using extended Euclidean algorithm and by hacking somehow at least some bits of the key or the state of the generator. In the main version using XOR, such an attack is not even possible. I did not consider any other types of attacks than those mentioned here, i.e.:  
\- dedicated type of attack based on known-plaintext attack on toy version,  
\- related key attacks,  
\- timing attacks,  
\- theoretically possible birthday attacks (see my comment in this thread).

Perhaps such a stream cipher could find applications on extremely resource-constrained devices. However, I don't know if I'll find the motivation to write a separate paper on this topic and if it's even worth it. I don't feel competent enough in the subject of cryptography (so I probably won't take on this task alone), I wasn't even able to get the opinion of anyone from the industry (it's a pretty closed industry, and I don't come from the crypto industry, I did it as a hobby).

Here is constant-time code, with some additional measures to prevent related-key attacks and to fill the key:

    #include <bitset>
    #include<iostream>
    
    //the initializer is there to fill the entire key s, additionally initializing s in this way helps to avoid recognizing keys with the same number of zeros, e.g. by adding 2^n to the key, which is important for the security of the algorithm, because it can lead to the generation of weaker x; this initialization is also to prevent key from being determined by simple modulo subtraction from weyl, if an attacker were to for example hack s and weyl, he could determine an initial value of weyl which in this case would not lead him to key
    
    struct xws { __uint128_t x, weyl, s; };

An additional feature is backtracking resistance, since it is not based on a bijective function, you must guess at least one bit in each iteration to reverse it, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05079. What do you think?"

Key ring file format?,5,1gts69k,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gts69k/key_ring_file_format/,9,2024-11-17 18:32:50,"I'm a professional software engineer, and I've written software to manage user-generated keys for a bespoke system in the past. The general gist was vary the encoding of the key data itself while associating it with a human-readable label in a flat file that was subsequently encrypted before being written to disk, and encrypted in RAM, only after being fully loaded, by a key that was part of the key management program. That key was not stored in plaintext in the program executable. It was stored in chunks with about 10 x the actual amount of data needed to store the key, interspersed randomly, and only assembled together, programmaticly, and in random fashion, and decoded into the actual key immediately before it's needed, and as soon as the operation is over, it's memory is zeroed back out until the key is needed again. If anyone had the program source code, they could easily implement a new master key and create their own key ring eco-system, but it was the only way I could come up with to be able to store several keys persistently, but securely, while allowing the user to manage their own keys as they saw fit.

Surely, there are better ways to manage user keys. PGP has a keyring. GPG has a keyring. Even GNOME has a keyring. How are they designed to keep keys persistently, but securely? Are there any design documents or research papers that describe such a system?"

the react-hook is described in more detail [here](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/async-state-management). id like to extend its functionality to have encrypted persistant data. my approach is the following and it would be great if you could follow along and let me know if im doing something wrong. all advice is apprciated.

im using indexedDB to store the data. i created some basic functionality to automatically persist and rehydrate data. im now investigating password-encrypting the data with javascript using the browser cryptography api.

i have a PR [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/dim/pull/8) you can test out on codespaces or clone, but tldr: i encrypt before saving and decrypt when loading. this seems to be working as expected. i will also encrypt/decrypt the event listeners im using and this should keep it safe from anything like browser extensions from listening to events.

the password is something the user will have to put in themselves at part of some init() process. i havent created an input for this yet, so its hardcoded. this is then used to encrypt/decrypt the data.

i would persist the unencrypted salt to indexedDB because this is then used to generate the key.

i think i am almost done with this functionality, but id like advice on anything ive overlooked or things too keep-in-mind. id like to make the storage as secure as possible.

  
\---

  
Edit 11/11/2024:

I created some updates to the WIP pull-request. The behavior is as follows.

\- The user is prompted for a password if one isn't provided programmatically.

\- This will allow for developers to create a custom password prompts in their application. The default fallback is to use a JavaScript prompt().

\- It also seems possible to enable something like ""fingerprint/face encryption"" for some devices using the webauthn api. (This works, but the functionality is a bit flaky and needs to be ""ironed out"" before rolling out.)

\- Using AES-GCM with 1mil iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the password.

\- The iterations can be increased in exchange for slower performance. It isn't currently configurable, but it might be in the future.

\- The salt and AAD need to be deterministic and so to simplify user input, the salt as AAD are derived as the sha256 hash of the password. (Is this a good idea?)

Ml-Kem encapsulate non-random bytes?,4,1gjbmz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1gjbmz8/mlkem_encapsulate_nonrandom_bytes/,6,2024-11-04 05:03:26,"    I am not a cryptographer, but I am trying to use cryptographic libraries and would like to do it safely. Unfortunately, for my use case it seems to require using them in a non-standard way. The APIs don't seem to fit my use case straight-forward.
    
    I was curious if it was theoretically possible and safe to use the ML-Kem encapsulation key to encapsulate a non-random value as the shared secret. 
    
    What I actually am wanting to do is use the encapsulation key to encapsulate an x25519 public key into the cipher text for a mutual authenticated hybrid setup. The decrypted public key would be used to derive a shared secret using the x25519 process. 
    
    If this is possible, the reason I think this is safe logically, not cryptographically, is this. Suppose ML-Kem is found to be broken, this is no weaker than directly sharing the EC public key which is far safer than directly sharing the raw symmetric key. If however, it is not and EC is defeated by quantum, the 'public' key is never shared publicly, so it should still be 'safe' as neither the public nor private keys are exposed. The only scenario I see that opens exposure is if both algorithms are broken in which case it's no worse than anything else that only uses both. The advantage is that it doesn't share the EC key publicly and you save 32 bytes. If however you include a 32byte hash of the EC public key in the shared message, the recipient could verify that the decryption was successful without an additional round trip and still using the same message size of a random value encapsulated and an additional x25519 key appended. Of course to be mutual, keys/ciphers need to be exchanged in the opposite direction as well.
    
    I am likely missing something very important, so if this is a bad idea, please explain why. If it is not possible, I would also like to know why. Please don't just tell me to use standard APIs (even if that's what I should do and will if necessary) because I don't learn anything that way.

Safe to store public key encrypted private key?,4,1g5jeak,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1g5jeak/safe_to_store_public_key_encrypted_private_key/,2,2024-10-17 00:10:42,"I am implementing an anonymous credential system following Lysyanskaya, 2002, specifically much of chapter 3. We assume that the user (not anonymous) U has a user public key PK^(U) (I will try to do my best without LaTeX support here re: notation) and user private key, SK^(U.) When creating the pseudonym N, this user creates a key pair (PK^(N,) SK^(N),) but will not store these credentials. Upon pseudonym creation only, U will provide the pseudonym public key PK^N and the pseudonym private key SK^(N), but encrypted with their own public key PK^(U). That is, Encrypt(message: SK^(N), withKey: PK^(U)). Let's call this value EK^(N) for encrypted key since the notation will become quite unwieldy otherwise.

If I want to allow this user to authenticate as N, my thinking is the server (organization O in Lysyanskaya) stores the pseudonym N, the pseudonym public key PK^(N) and the encrypted pseudonym private key, EK^(N). This way if the user really is who they claim to be, then O can encrypt some random message m with the pseudonym public key, provide the user only with the encrypted message Encrypt(message: m, withKey: PK^(N)) and the encrypted private key EK^(N).

If the user is not U, all this info will be useless to them. If the user is U and thus has SK^(U), they can then return to O the original message m, and I will know that they have the private key SK^(U) and thus are authenticated as pseudonym N.

I would be storing the following tuples in the database (in two separate tables).

Users table: (U, PK^(U))

Pseudonyms table: (N, PK^(N,) EK^(N))

Is this safe to store in the database?

I don't plan on exactly broadcasting this value, but say if there was a data breach, would it still be safe and not risk de-anonymizing the user?

It’s worth adding that I have since asked this question to ChatGPT and it said that we must always assume that PK^(U) is public and even if someone could not *decrypt* EK^(N), that they could tell that PK^(U) was used to encrypt it if provided with PK^(U), thus de-anonymizing the user U. It suggested using a key derivation function instead to derive SK^(N). That is, the server would not even send EK^(N) and would only send the encrypted message E(message: m, withKey: PK^(N))."

Given SHA256 is supposed to be random and well distributed, is it true to say that essentially each output can have an infinite and relatively equal number of collisions generated by infinite inputs.

i.e. given in reality we have infinite inputs to feed the function (think arbitrary long binary numbers), can we assume that a properly functioning hash function has ""even and reachable"" collisions across it's output space?

I'm looking for a method that doesn't devolve to turning the KEM into an OWF and then building a hash based signature scheme.  
I am aware that you can use a secure KEM to create a secure identification protocol like so(Assumes a secure channel):

    1- Register with the verifier for a given identity a KEM public key (This needs to be trusted in some manner). The entity must retain their private key.
    2- When an entity (Prover) claims to be a given identity, the verifier retrieve the known public key for that identity. If the identity is not known, either abort and fail or generate a random KEM public key(statically from the claimed non existent identity). Then encapsulate a shared secret using known_pub and send the challenge ciphertext.
    3- The prover deencapsulates the challenge ciphertext and recovers the shared secret. This shared secret serves as proof of identity and can either be directly returned to the verifier or used in a MAC.

However, unlike Schnorr's identification protocol, I can not find a way to use the Fiat-Shamir transformation\*. From my understanding, the reason why the KEM identification protocol works is that the random input to the encapsulation operation and the shared secret generated by it is kept secret. If I try to use a random oracle that is fed some data in our supposed signature scheme and use that to feed the encapsulation protocol, anyone with knowledge of the KEM public key(ie our verifier and would be adversary) can run the encapsulation function and generate the shared secret themselves without the need for the private key. I am not aware of any other way to convert a identification protocol into a signature scheme.

Is there any way to turn a generic secure KEM into a signature scheme without needing to dive into the specific properties of the KEM or it's underlying hard problem?"

[Sorry, but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/pqdtempzezsd1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d7fe92e26b9b8bab9961ae693dc8176c663d6f)

Note that only the computation of **\[C\]₁** changed -- the prover only uses the **a**i and Ψ*i* terms ℓ+1 to **m**.

The verifier computes the first ℓ terms of the sum :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/f0gz8tjrfzsd1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b2f75d4cb2f4473865f085c1e9146db3d390f1)

And the ᴇɪᴘ‒197 equation in the case of Ethereum on Fp^(12) is : 1?=\[*A*\]₁∙\[*B*\]₂×\[*α*\]₁∙\[*β*\]₂×\[*X*\]₁∙*G₂*×\[*C*\]₁∙*G*₂

# [Part 2 : Separating the public inputs from the private inputs with γ and δ](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16)

# The first attack [described in the tutorial I read](https://www.rareskills.io/post/groth16) and how it’s said to be prevented :

The assumption in the equation above is that the prover is only using Ψ(ℓ+1) to Ψ*m* to compute **\[C\]₁**, but nothing stops a dishonest prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ to compute **\[C\]₁**, leading to a forged proof.

For example, here is our current ᴇɪᴘ‒197 verification equation :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/676myt4ckzsd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=56d7cc9cab9a3ff25bb694d27ac4478677a0fbd8)

If we expand the C term under the hood, we get the following :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/hizdviiblzsd1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf492ad7210dcbebdc1676fbdb1c2f57422d191)

Suppose for example and without loss of generality that a=\[1,2,3,4,5\] and ℓ=3. In that case, the public part of the witness is \[1,2,3\] and the private part is \[4,5\].

The final equation after evaluating the witness vector would be as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/53rakghanzsd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1bbc018b64cc369762ef66360066cecb50a5314)

However since the discrete logarithm between the public and private point in ***G₂*** is 1, nothing stops the prover from creating an valid portion of the public witness as \[1,2,0\] and moving the zeroed out public portion to the private part of the computation as follows :

[Sorry but no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/2723fvcbqzsd1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5a504fc6951399e84d8929ded37a2d9cc9f483)

The equation above is valid, but the witness does not necessarily satisfy the original constraints.

Therefore, we need to prevent the prover from using Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ as part of the computation of **\[C\]₁**.

# Introducing γ and δ :

To avoid the problem above, the trusted setup introduces new scalars γ and δ to force Ψℓ+1 to Ψ*m* to be separate from Ψ**₁** to Ψℓ. To do this, the trusted setup divides (multiplies by the modular inverse) the private terms (that constitute **\[C\]₁**) by γ and the public terms (that constitute **\[X\]₁**, the sum the verifier computes) by δ.

Since the ***h***(***τ***)***t***(***τ***) term is embedded in **\[C\]₁**, those terms also need to be divided by γ.

[Again, no MathJax on reddit](https://preview.redd.it/ua70vela30td1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=f45e24b58202d9ae03c5ccf6ca405c6183374dfc)

The prover steps are the same as before and the verifier steps now include pairing by **\[*****γ*****\]₂** and **\[δ\]₂** to cancel out the denominators :

[The ᴇɪᴘ‑197 with Groth16 as it’s expected to be](https://preview.redd.it/jciw7eg470td1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba29c817295b1a07401a435481ba6fc83f9f766)

# The thing I’m not understanding :

*So it seems to me the description above is the attack is possible because the 2* ***G₂*** *points resulting from the witness input split for public inputs are equals and thus the discrete logarithm is know since it’s equal,* ***In the other case why is it required to modify both the private and public terms ? How could proofs be still faked without knowing the discrete logarithms between*** **δ** ***and G₂ ?***  
**Why not just divide the private terms that constitute \[C\]₁** ***by*** **δ** ***and leave the public terms as is*** *? This would mean :*

I am working on a lattice system based on the ISIS problem. ChatGPT keeps thinking this is a terrorist form of cryptography, but it's just inhomogeneous short integer solution.  With that out the way, I'm wondering about short secret generation. I've become partial to using a Gaussian distribution to sample from a set of integers. It's easy and yields consistently good results. 

I remember NIST saying something about how uniform selection was better, but I do not remember exactly what their logic was. Does Gaussian sampling create exploitable patterns in the output variables, or produce keys that are easier to brute force or something related to constant time implementations?

Concern for Speed and Scalability of NIST PQC?,13,1fpfqsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1fpfqsk/concern_for_speed_and_scalability_of_nist_pqc/,13,2024-09-25 16:23:42,"While I am glad that the NIST announced support for Post-Quantum Algorithms I am concerned about their performance.

Speed and scalability matters in the business world because all organizations are constrained by a budget.

While I was reading [CloudFlare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nist-post-quantum-surprise/) on the speed of Dilithium, Kyber, SPHINCS+, and others I was bothered by how much more time-consuming Dilithium and SPHINCS+ was. The PQC algorithms are slower than the classical ones.

I imagine this will be the reason why organizations hesitate to switch to post-quantum safe cryptosystems. They were already reluctant to adopt important technology like TLS and DNSSEC and RPKI in the past. And asking them to train their infosec and opsec teams to learn how to deal with these algorithms that slow down performance will be a difficult task."

At the moment I'm using DH X and Ed curves but I'm planning to upgrade to Post Quantum algorithms I didn't decided which one yet, surely PQ sign and hybrid encapsulation for encryption.

After I created the basic one-to-one communication with session keys I upgraded to only the sender key method, every message/data use forward secrecy and AES-256/GCM.

I created a little local chat demo using JSON as storage. It's possible use a ""realtime"" chat opening two accounts  in two cmd.

I uploaded windows+linux binaries with a little readme inside, nothing fancy, only cmd UI

In my opinion it's hard track and associate ""who write what to whom"" without access to the ends. At the moment, because it's only local, I didn't sign DB communication, but the underline code is already in place to check the authenticity of the sender.

In short this protocol should be anonymous and secure in pre-quantum in my opinion.

Thanks for every feedback and opinion.

I was wondering if instead of a simple resonance, you could have a chip that uses the reader's radio transmitter to induce a logical circuit to perform a digital signature using a key fused into the card, and trigger transistors to switch on the appropriate inductor capacitor circuits to represent that signature.

If the challenge is a MACed nonce and the key is hard to extract, you have a far more secure passive identification system.

Does this exist? Has it been tried?"

Ascon _ Short message with constant nonce,4,1f9ql1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1f9ql1r/ascon_short_message_with_constant_nonce/,6,2024-09-05 11:24:21,"Hello everyone,

I was analyzing Ascon in order to cipher very small plaintext (< rate).  
My main goal is to implement it without the need of authentication and probably with a constant nonce or at least a nonce which can be reused a lot of time.

The problem with Ascon is with short message the absorbing step of the sponge contruction (called plaintext in the NIST submission) is skipped and the ciphering is resumed by a xor between the data and bits coming from the initialisation step. Those bits in our case could be always the same if the nonce is constant.

My question are :

* Is it still possible to use the Ascon to cipher my data even if my nonce is constant ?
* What are the risks of it, if I do it ?
* Do you have better option of lightweigth cipher with no nonce?

Thank you for your help."

For probable security, SPHINCS+ seems great with short sk/pk but long signatures. It is also quite slow, making it very resistant if need be. Good choice for optimal security.

Falcon is my favorite by far as it only comes in two versions, Falcon512 and Falcon1024 comparable to RSA security. I think it is the easy choice to make. It is also quite fast.

Dilithium seems quite interesting too but I don’t know much about it. How does it differ from Falcon.

This is more of a Falcon vs. Dilithium post as they seem to be the more commonly used.

Why does Monero use a slightly tweaked version of the Schnorr Signature as compared to that described in Cryptography texts/literature?,26,1f3xj3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1f3xj3e/why_does_monero_use_a_slightly_tweaked_version_of/,5,2024-08-29 03:45:14,"Most Cryptography Text & Literature describe Schnorr Signature thus

- Private key 'x' & Public key P = xG where G is the generator
- M is the message to be signed
- Signer samples a random 'r' & computes R = rG
- Signer computes e = Hash(M || R) & s = ex + r
- Signer sends (s, e) as signature.

Verifier computes e' = Hash(M || sG - eP) & checks if e == e'

----  

Multiple Monero texts (say for e.g. ""Zero to Monero"") describe the Schnorr Signature a little different. 

- s is computed by the signer as s = ex - r (instead of s = ex + r)
- So obviously verifier verifies by computing e' =  Hash(M || sG +  eP)

-----------------


(Note, I do know that Monero doesn't use the Schnorr Signature directly but uses it through Ring Signatures - however, even there this +/- difference is there).

I don't think this makes much of a difference, however I am curious as to why Monero does this change.

--------- 


I also found a Crypto.SE comment (not question) which asks something similiar

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48616/prove-the-security-of-schnorrs-signature-scheme

Person who asked the question uses the Monero way & claims his reference as Wikipedia. However, currently the Wikipedia Schnorr Page uses the original way - so obviously it has changed since then. 

The moderator of Crypto.SE fgrieu asks in the comments 

> That description is not quite Schnorr's signature scheme as published (see reference and description in this question). Main difference is that in Schnorr's article the hash H
 has narrow output (about half the bitsize of q). **Also the minus sign is applied to x
 during computation of the public key, so that s=k+xemodq (that trivially does not matter to security).** And the notations differ. I wish I knew the origin of the variant in this question, Wikipedia, and the HAC 11.5.3. 

I think the origin of this variant is from Monero. But why?"

Meta programming encryption technique assumption,13,1f2clla,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1f2clla/meta_programming_encryption_technique_assumption/,8,2024-08-27 04:15:09,"Hi! Our engineers have developed and patented encryption technique where the the programm using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number generator) generate a unique and unpredictable encryption equitation for each encryption process.

I am not specialist in the cryptography, but our engineers ensures that this technique may be quantum resistant and flexible (can be tuned as symmetric or asymmetric encryption and can be used in different areas, like file encryption or securing communication channel).

I look for people who can express their opinion on this technique. Can you advice where I can find those people?

In a steps the process looks like follows:

1. Read byte array from the file

\[1,22,34,12,45,243,255,11,2,34\]

2. Determine a random variable n , based on entered values min and max

n = rd.randint(min, max)

n = rd.randint(8, 100)

n = 8

3. Split byte array into n parts (randomly, not same size)

\[\[1\], \[22\], \[34\], \[12\], \[45\], \[243\], \[255,11\], \[2,34\]\]

4. Convert 2D array to equation of 1D arrays:

\[1\]+\[22\]+\[34\]+\[12\]+\[45\]+\[243\]+\[255,11\]+\[2,34\]

5. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part

f(x) = aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)+replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)

x1,x2,x3,... - variable with keys for each function.

6. Determine a random variable n2 , based on entered values min2 and max2

n2 = rd.randint(min2, max2)

n2 = rd.randint(2, 8)

n2 = 2

7. Split equation into n2 parts by brakets randomly

f(x) = (aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)) +(replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8))

8. Apply a random encryption or encoding function with math operation for each part:

f(x) = otp((aes(\[1\], x1) +rsa(\[22\],x2)+otp(\[34\],x3)+aes(\[12\],x4)), x9)+ aes((replace(\[45\], x5)+aes(\[243\],x6)+ceaser(\[255,11\], x7)+elipse(\[2,34\],x8)), x10)

9. Repeat Steps 6 - Steps 8 required number of times or random number of times

However, there is never an opening of the commitment in the proof - i.e. at no point is the commitment opened at a random point sent by the verifier like is done in KZG.

I understand how the proof is sound even without the opening. It's because part of the equation which is proved is computed from the trusted setup by the prover & the other parts computed by the verifier again using the trusted setup. And the trapdoors to ensure that the prover has used the Trusted setup - else the proof won't verify. 

I am surprised however, how this point (no opening) is not mentioned in either the paper or any other description of Groth16 considering this seems to be a rather non-standard way of using KZG type of commitments. Or is this usage not considered at all to be ""commitments"" & hence this is not mentioned - i.e. I interpret them as commitments only because they look similar to KZG but Groth & others don't look at these as commitments."

* Are written from an excessively myopic perspective mimicking a novice who lacks sufficient real-world experience to understand the proper way some things are done. It’s easy to come up with new ideas and new ways to do things but it’s much harder to write real-world software systems and have a true appreciation for the way some things must necessarily work. 
* Extremely lacking in self-criticism, lacking in comparison to similar novel concepts that failed due to X Y Z, and lacking in how this novel concept is different from them
* Lacks source code for peer review/verification in the spirit of ""hey guys, just trust me on this”

All of that being said, I myself am embarking on writing a novel cryptography paradigm that imagines a new way to conceptualize encryption and follows this to its logical conclusion of an entirely new type of cipher unlike ARX, SP-box, Feistel, pseudo-hamad, etc., that’s in a class all of it’s own.

I am looking for advice/discussion to help me avoid common pitfalls with new/novel work. Some of the things I’ve thought of so far:

* Foremost, obey Schneier's Law!: hold out a glimmer of hope this work might be of some use to someone but anticipate I could be wasting weeks of effort on a trivially-debunked paradigm and cipher someone else breaks in 5 minutes.
* Significant emphasis on self-criticism! Lead with a most-conservative specific set of cases, circumstances, and conditions this work applies to and investigated usage in, explain how this work would be innapropriate for general usage or as a replacement for other encryption algorithms, etc. 
* The only thing claimed to be novel is the paradigm, not the cipher or any of the extensive followup work supporting the article. 
* Extensive recognition of existing work/techniques/concepts in cryptography and how these synergize, never conflict, with my new cryptography paradigm.
* Source code! In many languages! And lots of documentation and usages for everything and all the proper software goodies
* Judiciously limiting any broad generalizations to the absolute minimum, instead leaving these as exercises for the reader if they happen to think the same thing I do. Everything will be structured as concrete, formulaic, and ungeneralized as possible (while still indirectly hinting at the larger picture; I should be able to reserve that right, shouldn’t I?)
* Rationale/reasoning behind everything!, and cut out every nonessential aspect/detail that isn’t backed by a logical explanation of its necessity in the design.
* Structuring for skimability! 
* Real, concrete numbers and analyses on every angle/approach to cryptanalysis of my design that I can think of!

I’m eager for your suggestions and ideas to help me avoid common pitfalls writing a paper that presents new/novel work. My goal here in this forum is the same as my paper: to exchange knowledge and foster mutual learning.

I hope this question isn’t off-topic for this sub as I acknowledge Scheier’s Law, embrace being wrong, and seek only help on professional writing. No details about my specific topic or paper are mentioned here."

Meshtastic Cryptography sanity check,13,1emr5sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1emr5sg/meshtastic_cryptography_sanity_check/,9,2024-08-07 18:45:36,"Hey all, I find myself working on the cryptography of an Open Source project, Meshtastic. It currently uses AES256-CTR with pre-shared keys for communication. We’ve recently tightened the code-base up to work even harder to avoid IV re-use.

The project is squeezed by a few requirements, like the need for changes to be non-breaking if possible, the extremely slow data rates of LoRa, and the extremely limited ram and flash on many of the devices we support.

One of the known limitations with Meshtastic is that the keys are all PSK, and there’s no re-keying or forward secrecy for direct messages. Direct messages just re-use the shared channel key. I’ve jumped in to try to fix this.

I’m basing the effort on a drive-by pull request from a couple years back, that never went anywhere. The basic concept is to use a curve25519 diffie-hellman process. Part 1 of the DH calculation gives us a public/private keypair, and the node sends the public key with its node announce packets.

Then the remote node takes that incoming public key, and its own private key, and does part two of the DH exchange, giving it a shared secret. The current version of this code uses SHA-256 hashing step, as the raw DH result has “mathematical properties”. This hashed output will be used for AES-256-ctr encryption between the two nodes.



And here are the questions for the r/crypto brain trust:

Is a hashing step actually needed to evenly distribute the entropy of the curve25519 output, before using it as an AES key? I've not been able to find any work on how resistant AES is to that sort of problem. The original PR used a blake2b hashing step, but that overflowed the flash on some of our targets. I can just barely squeeze a SHA256 hash in, but if it's considered safe to skip, I’ll gladly do so, and have a bit more flash breathing room.

Are there any glaring flaws with this scheme? We’re not going to achieve secret-squirrel levels of encryption, but I’m trying to get this as right as possible given the constraints. You can find the in-development code at [https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/4379/files)

Thank you for your time, and happy Meshing!"

Why Not Use a Transpiler to Refactor Legacy Crypto Code?,4,1emcdrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1emcdrx/why_not_use_a_transpiler_to_refactor_legacy/,10,2024-08-07 08:53:29,"We are aware that crypto code is vulnerable to classic exploits such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, memory leaks, etc. 

The older legacy crypto code is the more likely it will have such flaws. I know other developers believe it is best to sometimes rewrite crypto code--however this is *not* always an option when the legacy code is massive and battle-tested. No one wants to go through the effort of auditing that or rewriting that from scratch and sometimes the code itself is *very esoteric* (e.g. OpenSSL).

So as a cost-effective compromise I was thinking about developing a transpiler that converts code vulnerable to such exploits and replace it with cleaner code.

What might be wrong with my server certificate verify function?,6,1ejg9cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1ejg9cd/what_might_be_wrong_with_my_server_certificate/,0,2024-08-03 17:50:16,"I am trying to write a TLS 1.3 implementation. I am going to limit myself to certificates containing secp256r1 public keys and the TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256 cipher suite for now.

This is my server certificate verify function:

    tls_record server_certificate_verify_record(
            std::string message_so_far_sha256, 
            std::string certificate_private) {
        sha256 ctx;
        ctx.update(std::string(64, ' '))
           .update(""TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify"")
           .update('\0')
           .update(hash_verify_context);
        auto signature_digest = ctx.hash();
    
        std::string signature = secp256r1::DER_ECDSA(
            signature_digest, certificate_private);
    
        tls_record record(ContentType::Handshake);
        record.write1(HandshakeType::certificate_verify);
        record.start_size_header(3);
        record.write2(SignatureScheme::ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256);
        record.start_size_header(2);
        record.write(signature);
        record.end_size_header();
        record.end_size_header();
        handshake_hasher->update(record.m_contents);
        return record;
    }

DER\_ECDSA is a function which takes the digest directly as a bigendian number (no further hashing) and performs a secp256r1 signature in DER format. I previously wrote a working implementation for TLS 1.2 and I am reusing the DER\_ECDSA function for its server\_key\_exchange record without modification.

The TLS client (cURL) successfully decrypts and decodes previous messages. It also decrypts and decodes this record and can tell that it is a certificate verify record and so I have confidence in my ChaCha20 cipher. However I then get a decrypt\_error alert from the client which means that the signature check is failing.

I am hashing (plaintext) records including (also tried excluding) the appended record type into the transcript. My server and client hello records were hashed to produce the handshake master secret which gives me mild confidence that I am correctly hashing records together for the transcript.

What other details might I be missing?"

Using a public key's points (other than the generator point) to calculate the order of the group (SECP256k1)?,5,1ej9equ,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1ej9equ/using_a_public_keys_points_other_than_the/,7,2024-08-03 12:47:46,"Imagine if we were on a mission to try to calculate the order of the cyclic group `n`

Given the order of the finite field `p`

    p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

Generator point `G`:

    G = (

        )

Which has the private key of `1`. 

Cofactor `h` is `1`. The equation is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`

We can find the `n` with **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm**

However, it's a bit confusing. [Here's the solution in Sage](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-to-calculate-the-order-of-secp256k1). It presents one code example:

        sage: p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663

What is `[0, 7]` specifically? These cannot be the coordinates of the `G`, since we already established that they are different.

And where in this calculation the `G` is even used?

What if we used instead of `G`, another point on the elliptic curve, that we know for sure that it sits on the curve and is part of our cyclic group. Like this one:

        (x,y) = (
        44886295857190546091508615621464465421050773292389158775895365558788257183826,

        )

The private key for this point sits somewhere between `2^129` and `2^130`. What would happen if we use this point, instead of `G` for our **Schoof-Elkies-Atkin** to calculate the `n` (order of the cyclic group)?

I have been researching which languages crypto libraries are used in production the most often. This matters to me because that means people are willing to trust the developers with their lives. And it seems FIPs-140-2 is a very important trait.

Here is a list of libraries that are at least mentioned on Wiki and that must have each see some use in production.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries

5/6 FIPS certified libraries are written in C. Why is that when C is plagued with code built on careless coding habits (no bounds checking for overflows)? Wouldn't make sense to publish FIPS libraries in Rust or C++ at least.

And of course it does not matter how much we complain about it. The developers are not going to change their language just because a newer language has more security features. But still--how come we are not seeing a growing list of FIPS-certified crypto APIs in more secure languages that businesses and governments can count on?

If the vast majority of crypto codebases are written in insecure languages like C why should we expect future crypto libraries to be written in safer languages? People new to the field need to study preexisting code, refactor it, and write their own code in said languages to get good at writing crypto code in those languages. But so far there is a serious shortage of production quality crypto code in safer languages that serves as educational material.

The Importance of Refactoring and Working with Legacy Code in Crypto,1,1ebma5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1ebma5a/the_importance_of_refactoring_and_working_with/,4,2024-07-24 23:44:54,"I have been reading the book ""Refactoring"" by Martin Fowler and he said it is possible to refactor code--even if it is messy as long as you can test the refactored code with test cases.

"Transitioning from an existing stream-ciphered (TCP) stream to a TLS connection, keeping the same security assumptions",6,1eb5aad,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1eb5aad/transitioning_from_an_existing_streamciphered_tcp/,7,2024-07-24 11:08:29,"Hello, I'm in the process of trying to optimise an applicative network stack by replacing an old school TCP stream of framed datagrams with a QUIC-based connection (between a client and a server). The TCP stream can be considered properly E2E encrypted and both peers are authenticated in the eyes of the other (no MITM possible at this stage). As a matter of simplicity and not changing what's already working, I want to keep the whole auth/encryption phase in the start of the legacy TCP protocol and optimistically upgrade to the QUIC-based one if both peers allow it, instead of immediately starting a TLS. Note that both servers/listeners (TCP and QUIC) are in the same process, so they have shared memory.

If I were transitioning from TCP to a new simple TCP stream (not QUIC), it would probably be sufficient to:

* have the client identify itself in cleartext in the new stream, possibly with a random value that was sent in the old stream by the server, so the server knows which encryption key will be needed
* immediately have both peers start conversing with symmetric encryption, using keys that were sent in the old encrypted stream
* I don't think any DH key exchange is necessary at all
* that's it! **Correct me if I'm wrong**

But in my case, QUIC is based on TLS, which is higher level than simple stream-ciphered TCP. Though I don't think I actually need any of this certificate chain/trust store stuff. I could simply have both peers generate a random self-signed cert to use them as simple keypairs, and omit every single metadata field (including the `SubjectAlternativeName` of the domain name). These certs would be sent over the old TCP stream by both peers, and then they would initiate a mutual TLS (mTLS) over the new QUIC connection. At this stage, the QUIC connection is encrypted between the same exact peers as the old TCP stream. **Does this sound correct? Am I making wrong assumptions? Is this over-engineered?**

A few notes:

* some certificate generation libraries require a domain name, so I could use an invalid TLD (RFC2606) like ""myprojectname.invalid"". It wouldn't be read anyway, as both peers check certs by strict equality/fingerprint.
* generating certs may be slow, in which case the server could generate a single one in memory, on startup, with a very high expiration date (or none, if possible in x.509), and reuse it every time. Clients would check its validity with strict equality with the one sent over TCP anyway, so the long expiration doesn't weaken security at all. Clients would probably still create one different cert per connection attempt, to make user fingerprinting harder. It shouldn't take more than a few millisecond to generate an EC key and that's acceptable on a client device

*Final note: I'm a bit of a newbie in crypto. I think I have a decent understanding of the general concepts, but it's pretty much 100% self-taught – and ""self-taught cryptologist"" doesn't sound great in a CV or a protocol definition document. I know that it can be easy to overlook MITM or replay attack vectors, and these are what worry me the most. Also none of this is for a very serious project, I won't lose any money or reputation if I'm given bad advice (but please don't* 👉👈)."

What is exactly Randstorm vulnerability?,3,1e8kqd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e8kqd7/what_is_exactly_randstorm_vulnerability/,4,2024-07-21 07:01:15,"I've read [the article from Unciphered about it](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards), multiple times, and still fail to understand it

It basically says that wallets generated by BitcoinJs front end library from 2011 to 2015 are vulnerable because of the poor randomness generation. Especially those generated between May 4, 2011 to March 2012

But it's really vague on explaining what the actual exploit is. It could be just summarized as: *it used Math.random() for randomness before March 2014, and it is a bad function*

Let's look at the initial commit from [March 4, 2011](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee) : eckey.js is used for generating the private key, while rng.js and prng4.js in the jsbn folder are used for harvesting randomness.

# rng.js

If `rng_pool` is not already initialized, it is filled with random values from `Math.random()`

    while(rng_pptr < rng_psize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
        t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t >>> 8;
        rng_pool[rng_pptr++] = t & 255;
      }

`Math.random()` according to the [article](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d) has the cycle of 2\^60 values before they repeat. The article also mentions that it [fails modern benchmark test](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/8b43c628c39cc39aa205), but I'm not sure about them

Is `Math.random()` the whole weakness of the story? What is the weakness actually about?

Later, the time in milliseconds is seeded to the pool

    function rng_seed_time() {
      rng_seed_int(new Date().getTime());
    }

And later for

    SecureRandom.prototype.nextBytes = rng_get_bytes;

we initialize the state, and pass the pool as the key into the RC4 cipher

    rng_state = prng_newstate();
    rng_state.init(rng_pool);

from prng4.js

# prng4.js

which creates a 256 values array

    this.S = new Array();

and fills it with the loop

    for(i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
        j = (j + this.S[i] + key[i % key.length]) & 255;
        t = this.S[i];
        this.S[i] = this.S[j];
        this.S[j] = t;
      }

# eckey.js

eckey.js uses SecureRandom() and creates our private key

    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);

But again, this tells us next to nothing about the actual vulnerability and what attacks might be used. Unciphered's article suggests that if we have GUID or IV (I guess that's a public key?), then we can do the work with just 2\^32 to 2\^64 values (2\^48 most commonly)

Also, not sure about the clicks being added in the entropy pool, apart from:

`<body onClick='rng_seed_time();' onKeyPress='rng_seed_time();'>` comment.

In what way, other things are added into entropy pool apart from the initial timestamp seed?

*Edit July 23, 2024:*

Sorry, I forgot that [ecdsa.js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/c0d740d2d4cd35ab18dc35e23936db42f17ad2ee/ecdsa.js) also has its own context

# ecdsa.js

Basically `getBigRandom()` method is realized in this file with `rng = new SecureRandom();`

    Bitcoin.ECDSA = (function () {
    var ecparams = getSECCurveByName(""secp256k1"");
    var rng = new SecureRandom();
    ....
    var ECDSA = {
    getBigRandom: function (limit) {
    return new BigInteger(limit.bitLength(), rng)
    .mod(limit.subtract(BigInteger.ONE))
    .add(BigInteger.ONE)
    ;
    },

Best Crypto Libraries to Study and Learn From,14,1e73o7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e73o7j/best_crypto_libraries_to_study_and_learn_from/,9,2024-07-19 08:24:41,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to research coding techniques for constant-time when programming cryptography. Of course a simple solution is study and read **the source code** from pre-existing crypto libraries.

Which crypto libraries would you recommend I study and learn from? The ideal crypto libraries are the ones whose source code is:

1. Easy to Understand
2. Constant-Time
3. Lab Tested to Be Secure Against Common Attacks (E.g. FIPS-validated)

The closest library I could think of so far is BearSSL since Thomas Pornin wrote decent documentation on constant-time cryptography and Multi-Precision Arithmetic.

What other such libraries do you recommend?"
Question about Groth16 trusted setup & also about the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony,4,1e6w0s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e6w0s2/question_about_groth16_trusted_setup_also_about/,9,2024-07-19 00:22:14,"This is the CRS generated by Groth16 Trusted Setup.

https://preview.redd.it/6j48x6a1redd1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f10d930771d9ea0147e8ccb5342d551e4942b7

As per the moonmath manual this is a circuit specific Trusted Setup & I agree with the moonmath manual on this. If the number of gates in the circuit changes, then the full CRS changes.

&#x200B;

If you split this into 2 phases

\- Phase 1 - you generate the Powers of Tau for A & B (i.e. Powers of Tau for G1 & G2) & discard Tau as  toxic waste

\- Phase 2 - you generate the remaining things

However, there is a problem here - using just the Tau powers, you can compute every part of the remaining CRS except one part - the last part which I have marked in Red - the h(tau).t(tau) part.

This cannot be generated without knowing the value of t(tau) & the value of t(tau) changes if the number of gates increases or decreases.

&#x200B;

So why split into 2 parts - this is what I think is the purpose of splitting into 2 parts.

It's to enable the perpetual powers of Tau ceremony.

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377)

&#x200B;

In the above description of the Perpetual Powers of Tau Ceremony, I see the following

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick a round from the common phase 1

\> any zk-SNARK project can pick any point of the ceremony to begin their circuit-specific second phase.

&#x200B;

What I think this means is

\- Perpetual Rounds means Phase 1 doesn't stop.

\- In Round 1 of Phase 1, they generate a CRS for n gates - they generate a tau, compute the powers of tau & store it. They also compute Tn(tau) & store it along with it.

\- In Round 2 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+1) gates - they generate a new tau from the older tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+1(tau) along with it.

\- In Round 3 of Phase 1, they  generate a CRS for (n+2) gates - they generate a new tau from the 2nd tau, compute the powers of the new tau & store the powers. They also store the newly computed Tn+2(tau) along with it.

&#x200B;

And so on & so forth - anything someone has a circuit with a higher number of gates, another round of Phase 1 is done. 

&#x200B;

Now if a zkSNARK with n gates wants to use the Phase 1 output, they use the Round 1 output, if they have n+1 gates, they use the Phase 1 Round 2 output & so on.

And since the output contains T(tau) also along with the powers of tau, the full second phase can be computed for that tau

Can someone who understands this, let me know if what I describe is correct? If it is not, how what is the procedure used which allows Phase 2 to be done without knowing the value of T(tau)? T(tau) is required for generate the CRS which helps compute the commitment of H.T - this is that part of the CRS -  (tau^i * t(tau))/delta}_{i=0 to n-2}. T depends on number of gates in the circuit - i.e. T(tau) changes if now of gates in the circuit changes."

Trying to create a HMAC length extension toy attack,6,1e3dyvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e3dyvt/trying_to_create_a_hmac_length_extension_toy/,5,2024-07-14 16:53:46,"Hi

  
I want to write some code to demonstrate a length extension attack on a homemade HMAC construction. Where a signature is constructed as:

digest = hash(key+ message)

and then I want to construct a digest from the output of those two.

I read up on it a little, and figured I could do a really simple small code example in c# (if anyone can help with snippets in other similar languages it would be really cool too :D )

**My approach**

  
So I figured that if I have a secret and a message that add up to the sha1 block length of 64 bytes, then the hash of these two would simply be a single block of hashing.

  
Then I could simply take the signature of this message, and append whatever to it, from which I would get a new hash, which would valid

And so I made this little snippet:



`using System.Security.Cryptography;`

`using System.Text;`



`// secret and message, together they are 64 bytes`

`string secret = ""secret222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222"";`

`string msg = ""data"";`

`// the digest`

`var digest = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg);`



`// forging digest, simply trying to append ""appendeddata""`

`string append = ""appendeddata"";`

`// and now trying to forge a new digest:`

`var forgedPayload = StringExtensions.hash(digest + append);`

`// and then checking it` 

`var constructed = StringExtensions.hash(secret+msg+append);`



`public static class StringExtensions`

`{`

`public static string hash(this string input)`

`{`

`if (input == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));`

`using (SHA1 sha256 = SHA1.Create())`

`{`

`byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(input);`

`byte[] hashBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);`



`StringBuilder hash = new StringBuilder();`

`foreach (byte b in hashBytes)`

`{`

`hash.Append(b.ToString(""x2""));`

`}`

`return hash.ToString();`

`}`

`}`

`}`

Sometimes expressing a constraint ‘in reverse’ is simpler, and there you use <— syntax followed by a === to express the relevant constraints explicitly.

How many circuit constraints do you really need to demonstrate you know a hash-preimage for example?

Which subgroup to select(2q or q) for finite field discrete logarithm?,4,1e0gtt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1e0gtt9/which_subgroup_to_select2q_or_q_for_finite_field/,6,2024-07-11 00:00:47,"From my understanding, in order to have maximally hard discrete logarithm instances, one needs to instantiate it over an adequately large prime modulus p such that p = 2q + 1 where q is a prime number. Doing so allows the creation of subgroups of order 2, q, and 2q.

When a generator that generates the subgroup of order q is used for discrete logarithm, you lose half the possible outputs compared to the subgroup of order 2 but you also prevent leakage regarding the output from what I recall. The converse is true when you use a generator for the 2q order group(more outputs but you leak a bit of information). This means from a cryptographic perspective, both options are effectively similar(either q possible outputs or 2q possible outputs but you can exclude one half of the outputs due to leakage).

I would like to know if there would be any reason to prefer one subgroup over another for uses of finite field discrete logarithms in this scenario."

Implementing password recovery in my app,7,1dxew5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1dxew5m/implementing_password_recovery_in_my_app/,2,2024-07-07 07:00:09,"Hello. I have an Android App that stores encrypted data using a key derived from user entered password (PBKDF2). If any user forgets their password, they loose access to all their data. Hence, I am trying to implement a password recovery feature that is hacker resistant, including in cases where the phone may be rooted and the sqlite database is accessible.

Here's my solution. I randomly generate and store an internal password in the app. I then encrypt the user's password using this internal password using AES, and further encrypt the output and the user's email using my RSA public key. I store this RSA encrypted value.

If the user forgets their password, I submit the RSA encrypted value to my website. The website will decrypt the value using my private key and will email the app encrypted user password value to the email address found, as an attachment. On clicking the attachment, the user password is decrypted using the internal password, user is logged in and made to change their password.

Do you foresee any weaknesses with this approach? I guess if the user's phone is compromised, then the person holding the phone can check emails and retrieve the password. So perhaps adding a secret question and answer would help, but some people end up forgetting the answer to that as well."

Proposal to reverse/crack a PRNG - prvhash/Gradilac,2,1dh32gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1dh32gj/proposal_to_reversecrack_a_prng_prvhashgradilac/,6,2024-06-16 03:25:16,"It's not a new project, and I consider it myself complete. However, I'm still looking for validation of my ""security"" tests. The challenge is not hard - try to reverse/find initial state of the system **after** 5 (or maybe 6) initial calls to prvhash\_core64, and from any number of further XORed adjacent outputs. The project is here: [https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash](https://github.com/avaneev/prvhash), but I'll copy&paste the C function here, so you do not have to read and wander much. It does look simple, but it's not a ""low-effort"" kind of thing, I do really can't reverse it with SAT solving, and due to its complex feedback nature I have little idea how to build a reverse formula. Seed,Hash are seed variables, can be initialized to any values (lcg is best kept zero) - so any solution is good here, if you can find breakable initial numbers, that's good too. Note that without XORing SAT solving is very fast, it's a vital part.

`static uint64_t prvhash_core64( uint64_t* const Seed0, uint64_t* const lcg0, uint64_t* const Hash0 )`

`{ uint64_t Seed = *Seed0; uint64_t lcg = *lcg0; uint64_t Hash = *Hash0;`

    Seed *= lcg * 2 + 1;
    
    const uint64_t rs = Seed >> 32 | Seed << 32;
    
    Hash += rs + 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
    
    lcg += Seed + 0x5555555555555555;
    
    Seed ^= Hash;
    
    const uint64_t out = lcg ^ rs;
    
    *Seed0 = Seed; *lcg0 = lcg; *Hash0 = Hash;
    
    return( out );

`}`

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single ""compressed"" PRNG output):

    v = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
    v ^= prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );"

I've now written a bit of code and have come to the point where I'd need to encrypt the files. My plan was to use asymmetric encryption where the secret key is encrypted using a user-provided password so that the user needs to decrypt the private key to view the screenshots taken / data extracted from the screenshots. 

I have now learned that asymmetric encryption is very slow and it's generally not designed to encrypt large chunks of data, so I'm not sure how to continue. Do you think asymmetric encryption is feasible for this? Any idea how else to do the encryption? Ideally I would like for the server that takes the screenshots to not have a key that can decrypt the files since that wouldn't be as secure. "

I can combine them with XOR to get c3 = c1 ^ c2, and somehow obtain a3 by some publicly known function f(a1, a2) 

Someone in possession of K, given c3, a3, iv1, iv2, should be able to verify that c3 is indeed composed of some XOR combinations of ciphertext that they have encrypted in the past. 

To be more precise, what I'm looking for is some kind of homomorphic encryption that respects XOR, which can easily be done with a stream cipher, but I'm also wondering if it's possible to preserve authenticity, at least as far as whether the ciphertext is composed of authentic ciphertext."

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis and Fault Injection Attack,8,1d6gzb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1d6gzb7/rules_to_defend_against_power_analysis_and_fault/,5,2024-06-02 11:21:55,"I have compiled a list of rules on how to defend against power analysis and fault injection attacks

[here](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/rules-to-defend-against-fault-and-power-analysis-attacks).

Here is a summary of the attacks and defenses:

1. Power Analysis Attack: What Is It?
   1. Simple Power Analysis
      1. Random Noise: A Simple Defense Against Simple Power Analysis
      2. Masking: A Second Defense
      3. Montgomery Ladder: A Third Defense
   2. Introduction to Differential Power Analysis and Higher-Order Analysis
   3. Defenses Against Differential Power Analysis
      1. Higher-Order Masking
      2. Blinding for Public-Key Cryptography
      3. Perform Decoy Operations
      4. Montgomery Ladder
      5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values
      6. Operation Shuffling
      7. Non-Deterministic Processor 

Rules to Defend Against Power Analysis

1. Apply noise by executing programs in parallel on several CPU cores.
2. Apply masking. This can defend up to the nth-order differential power analysis attack. However, an (n+1)th order differential power analysis attack can bypass this defense.
3. If you are programming a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography you can use [~blinding~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) to protect the private key from power analysis attacks.
   1. You can blind the message itself.
   2. You *should* also blind the exponent used for encryption too.
4. Apply Decoy operations: calculations that *pretend to be authentic calculations based on secret data but are not in reality.*
5. Randomize Access to Confidential Array Values: Loop through elements of an array of secret values in random order.

1. Fault Injection Attack: What Is It?
   1. How Practical Is It?
   2. Why You Should Still Care About Fault Injection Attacks Demanding Physical Access
   3. Voltage Glitch Attack: A Practical, Remote Fault Injection Attack Targeting Intel Systems
   4. Electromagnetic Fault Injection Attack
2. Defenses Against Fault Injection Attack
   1. Use Nontrivial Constants
   2. Clear Variables After Use
   3. Search for Fault-Injection Resistant Implementations

In general, you can tell I really started to struggle to find techniques to defend against fault injection attacks. It is not well documented. Nevertheless my research tells me that Intel systems can be affected by voltage glitch attacks. These attacks can happen remotely and only cost \~$30 USD.

I also would appreciate any code samples of power analysis and fault injection resistant algorithms for common crypto operations. I think its a good idea we build a habit of programming our crypto APIs to defend against such attacks--especially in a world where we rely on someone else to do our computing for us (e.g. cloud computing).

Is an algebraic field with a hard logarithm enough for FHE?,9,1d17ti8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1d17ti8/is_an_algebraic_field_with_a_hard_logarithm/,2,2024-05-26 13:31:34,"P = kG where P and G are elliptic curve points: it’s hard to find k given P and G. That’s your hard logarithm.

Once you have both addition and multiplication, do you need anything else to operate meaningfully on data? Are there constant time algorithms you can’t perform? Is limiting yourself to constant-time algorithms too restrictive?

RSA unlike ECDSA operates on finite field elements where you do have both addition and multiplication. Discrete log is sub-exponential but still hard there. What’s missing for practical FHE?

It was dealing with the size of 52 factorial, or the number of unique shuffles in a deck of playing cards. https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html

I need your help looking for a page about visualizing a brute force attack on either 128 bits or 256 bits (I can't recall exactly). I stumbled upon it some years ago and don't remember much about it. It may not even be online any longer. If I recall correctly, it was an analogy of a person talking with a bucket of dirt or water some large distance (perhaps across a country? Earth to Sun? Not sure). The analogy was approaching the infeasibility of brute forcing these insanely large numbers. It wasn't showing the impracticality via time though.

I'm familiar with Bruce Schneier's explanation on the [thermodynamic limits of brute forcing a 256-bit symmetric key](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/the_doghouse_cr.html). I typically refer to this analogy.
Jeff Bonwick, the creator of ZFS, blogs about [boiling oceans with 128 bits](https://web.archive.org/web/20061111054630/http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/date/20040925#128_bit_storage_are_you). There is this blog about [searching grains of sand for a 128-bit key](https://richardwarrender.com/2016/04/encrypt-data-using-aes-and-256-bit-keys/).

Anyone familiar with any other analogies for brute forcing 128-bits or 256-bits? On the off-chance, is someone here familiar with the post I'm looking for? It might not even be related to brute force, but just visualizing the sheer size of the number.

Thanks."
Rules for Constant-Time Programming,11,1d0o0li,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1d0o0li/rules_for_constanttime_programming/,17,2024-05-25 18:07:08,"When programming cryptosystems there are several rules cryptographic engineers need to follow to ensure their cryptosystems are constant-time whenever secret data is managed.

I am researching those and have compiled [the in-progress list](https://www.programcryptography.com/post/timing-attack-defenses) here.

I summarize it below. What suggestions would you have to improve this list?:

No program is vulnerable to timing attacks if its execution time is independent of any secret value.

1. When considering using a third-party library consider if the third-party library must manage secret information. If so check if the third-party library has been tested and verified to be constant-time. Most [\~do not\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf)!
2. \~Only use secret information in a computation if the secret's value does not affect the system resources used nor duration of said computation.\~
3. Choose to use an algorithm that is designed to be constant-time in the first place!
4. Never use secret values to decide what code to execute next.
5. Never use secret values to determine which memory addresses to access.
6. Use ""unsigned"" data types to store bytes of data. Using the ""signed"" reserved keyword will cause the loss of the most significant bit in each byte!
7. Always generate random data from cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators. An excellent list of CSPRNGs may be [\~found here\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators/secure-random-generators-csprng) in Nabokov's excellent guide on[ \~Practical Cryptography\~](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/).
8. Zeroize secret data *\~immediately\~* **after use. Check out Aumasson's secure coding guidelines for a list of** [**\~secure-wipe functions\~**](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#clean-memory-of-secret-data) **that do this.**
9. [\~Typecast\~](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding?tab=readme-ov-file#always-typecast-shifted-values) shifted values.
10. Any loop iteration leaks the number of iterations taken.
11. Any memory access leaks the address or index accessed.
12. Any conditional statement leaks which branch was selected.
13. You can assume how your CPU handles addition, multiplication, logical operations, and bitwise shifts are constant-time. Division is a unique case.
14. If you know a proof-assistant language such as Coq you should first make the program in a proof-assist language and compile that.
15. Use dynamic analysis tools against the final executable to test for constant-time. [\~Reputed ones\~](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1121.pdf) include and are not limited to: ""ctgrind"" (a patch of Valgrind by Adam Langley from Google), ""dudect"", or ""ctverify"".
16. If you can afford it allow a third-party to do a professional source code audit of the codebase."

Are there any efforts to implement a QUIC-like protocol on top of raw packets rather than UDP?,4,1cyy2yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1cyy2yb/are_there_any_efforts_to_implement_a_quiclike/,2,2024-05-23 12:12:17,"UDP protects the transport layer from malformed packets. However, the transport layer already has a mechanism for discarding malformed packets: decryption will fail.

If instead of using the UDP packet's checksum to detect many corrupted bits, it could use the checksum to attempt to correct a few bits.

This would improve network quality in noisy conditions (particularly non-civilian) where requesting a retransmission is slower or more costly than attempting error correction.

Error correction for UDP packets is pretty much brute force, and flipped bits in the checksum vs the payload are not created equal. So you would want to use raw packets with a dedicated error correcting code.

Required Math to Program Crypto?,0,1csyqii,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1csyqii/required_math_to_program_crypto/,23,2024-05-15 18:16:26,"Hello everyone,

I am researching what math you need to program classical cryptography for a [book I am writing](https://helpthisbook.com/fosres/program-cryptography-volume-1-math-for-classical-cryptography).

Not all the math found in cryptography textbooks is required to program the cryptosystem itself.

From my research here is a list of the math you **must** know if you want to program cryptosystems:

1. Binary Arithmetic: You have to know how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and get the remainder from binary division. The reason is you need to know how to do that to manage massive numbers stored in binary form on the machine. In addition to knowing how to do that for managing massive numbers you also need to know modular arithmetic, which is my next topic.
2. Modular Arithmetic: You have to be able to all elementary arithmetic and apply the result to the modulus operation (addition, subtraction, etc.). Modulus operations are found in just about every cryptosystem I have studied so far--from ciphers to hashes.
3. Multi-Precision Arithmetic: Public-key cryptography demands multiplying and even raising numbers larger than 64-bits in size by triple-digit numbers. We live in a world of 64-bit CPUs. When you need to store a number larger than what can fit in only 64 bits you have to split the binary representation across several 64-bit words and carry out the math operation across them.
4. Finite Field Arithmetic: Finite Fields are used in industry-standard ciphers including AES and in public-key cryptosystems such as RSA. Doing arithmetic with binary digit representations of finite fields, called binary fields, is mandatory to program such cryptosystems.
5. Prime Numbers: You \*have\* to know how to generate huge prime numbers. They are critical in protecting the secret key! There are efficient techniques for generating huge prime numbers. They are called techniques for generating ""probable primes""--numbers that are most likely prime based on a few numerical tests such as the Rabin-Miller test or Lucas-Lehmer Probabilistic Primality test.

I would argue the five concepts above are essential for programming cryptosystems. If there is anything I missed please comment below and let me know. Would love to hear from you!

Root finding in multivariate Coppersmith,9,1crqk3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1crqk3h/root_finding_in_multivariate_coppersmith/,1,2024-05-14 07:09:41,"Hello!

TL;DR: is there any library for multivariate polynomial root finding over the integers?

I'm trying to implement an attack on RSA with known bits of p by using Coppersmith, such as shown in [this paper](https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2008/53500412/53500412.pdf). In my case I have three blocks of lost bits, so it should be fine. The idea of Coppersmith is to first build and reduce a lattice, which is the costly part, and then convert some of the rows of the lattice back to polynomials that should have solutions over the integers that match the bits we're looking for. Finding the roots of a set of multivariate polynomials should have a very small cost when compared to lattice reduction.

However, I'm encountering a nasty surprise in my program. Lattice reductions take much (MUCH) less time than multivariate root finding, which is the limiting factor of my implementation. As of now I'm using a Sage script to solve the system, but it is too slow. Is there any library for integer multivariate root finding? At this point I don't care whether it's Python, C, C++, Fortran or whatever, I just want something fast that works for large integers.

Thanks in advance!"

Since my PhD will most likely have something to do with implementing cryptography I was thinking I would do something similar for my master's as warm up. 

My current idea basically is about finding curves that would do better than curve25519 in some (however niche) areas. For example, [optimal prime fields with low hamming weight](https://www.cryptolux.org/images/2/25/ICCSNT2011.pdf) seems to offer very good performance on 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. Surprisingly I don't think anyone has tried to standardize a 128-bit security curve on such prime fields yet, so I was thinking maybe I can find a curve based on such a field that satisfies the SafeCurve criteria, implement it for atmega128, do some benchmark with existing x25519 implementations and see if mine is better. Although I'm not really confident about this idea since I might've just missed some work that people have already done on this topic, or there's something fundamentally wrong with this idea since I'm not really an expert in microcontrollers or optimized implementations.

Since my university doesn't have a huge cryptography faculty, I'm seeking advice from y'all on the subreddit. Do you think my idea would be good for a thesis or do you have any other ideas? Thanks!"

So from that one could expect perhaps a roughly 50/50 usage ratio. CFB seems to have some significant advantages. It requires no padding and is not susceptible to IV prediction (BEAST). So historically it seems we would have been better off for SSL/TLS if it had been based on CFB rather than CBC.

Something I have just recently learned, CFB is nicer in that the IV only has to be unique (you could use a counter). CBC requires a random IV. The interesting thing is that the NIST document was wrong about this in that it claimed the IV characteristics were the same between the two.

I understand the performance advantage of counter mode, this question is just about CFB vs CBC.

* The traces only record one round of AES, not the entire process. I'm not sure if this is an issue as the theory doesn't make it clear whether the entire trace for the AES operation is needed or if it's okay to have just one round, but it could cause issues.
* The points of interest that I'm selecting are not appropriate. I'm not really sure how to rectify this besides using another method (I'm currently using the difference of means method and I have seen that there are other methods available, e.g. sum of squared differences or PCA).

Are zero knowledge proofs still valid when you work on polynomials mod X^N + 1?,11,1cbsd4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1cbsd4s/are_zero_knowledge_proofs_still_valid_when_you/,7,2024-04-24 02:36:30,"The FALCON signature scheme uses polynomials modulo x^n - 1. So 1 + x^3 + x^(n+3) becomes 1 + 2x^3
And modular arithmetic still works when you roll your polynomials up like this. (Not relevant, just giving the inspiration for this question.)

Zero knowledge proofs operate on gigantic polynomials, that are known by both prover and verifier.

Can both parties just agree to work modulo x^700 - 1 for example?

Real world zero-knowledge provers require 100s of gigabytes of RAM and are painfully slow.

Extending this, the verifier could specify the exponent N. They could even specify a dozen exponents and get a dozen proofs to really capture the constraints of the problem."

Is producing a QAPs with no remainder a zero-knowledge proof?,4,1c9qvcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1c9qvcc/is_producing_a_qaps_with_no_remainder_a/,4,2024-04-21 14:49:35,"I followed the following blog post

[https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)

You start with some problem f(**y**) = 0, where y is some group of values and f could be just about any problem, maybe 'find a set of values y\_i for the squares in this Sudoku', or 'Hash(y) - hashVal'

You want to convince someone you know **y** without revealing it.

You convert f() into a 'recipe' of very steps, 'add y\_a and y\_b to get val1' then 'multiply val1 and y\_b to get val2'.

List out those steps as a series of constraints:

y\_a + y\_b = val1

val1 \* y\_b = val2

etc.

Now as the prover, actually input the value of **x** you know to get the values for val1, val2 etc.

Produce a big secret vector s of all inputs and intermediate values that appear in the constraints (1, y\_0, y\_1, ... y\_n, val1, val2, val3 ...)

Construct a giant matrix equation of the form

As . Bs - Cs = **0**

where rows of A and B have one or two non-zero values, and rows of C have one non-zero value, and '.' is a element-wise product.

Multiply this out to get the constraints back, to double-check you didn't mess up.

Each row i = {1, 2, 3, ... n} encodes a constraint.

We now replace the matrices with polynomials (a + bx + cx\^2 ...)

s.**A**(x) \* s.**B**(x) - s.**C**(x)

We check we didn't mess up by inserting values of x = {1, 2, 3 ... n}, which, by design, should give us our list of constraints back, and evaluate to 0.

Z = (x-1))(x-2)(x-3)...(x-n) evaluates to 0 when x = {1, 2, 3 ... n}, and so we can set the right hand side to be some polynomial times this

s.**A**(x) \* s.**B**(x) - s.**C**(x) = H(x) \* Z(x)

We now divide by Z(x) to get H(x) + some remainder.

If the remainder is non-zero then something went wrong. Does that mean that if the remainder *is* 0, then we can present the polynomials, A, B, C, H as a zero-knowledge proof that we knew **y**?

Verification starts by constructing the constraints from f(), check that they match A, B, C.

Then what? The verifier doesn't have access to s to verify the equation.

What can we give the verifier to verify the equation? I'm not fussed about keeping the proof succinct or performant. I'm just learning. Something intuitive but maybe broken is the checkpoint I need"
"Keccak-f is invertible but not uniquely, can we exploit this?",8,1c8vg57,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1c8vg57/keccakf_is_invertible_but_not_uniquely_can_we/,6,2024-04-20 12:28:38,"SHAKE’s security relies on the fact that 256 bits of the output are destroyed, and 256 bits of the input are fixed to 0 and cannot be chosen by the individual performing the hash.

F1600 is not uniquely invertible, it is nevertheless invertible: from an output, you can calculate some input that produces that output.

If you start from some hash, fill out the rest of the F1600 state arbitrarily and try to perform this inversion, you’ll get an input where the last 256 bits of the state are not 0 and so this input is not an allowed preimage.

The χ step of the inversion gives you freedom to set specific bits in the f1600 input. If we could just figure out some set of choices here that sets the 256 end bits of the ‘input’ to 0, we have a way to create SHA3 collisions!

What makes this hard to do?

But what stops an attacker from setting up an AP without SAE-PK enabled, or even with WPA2? How does the client know the network is supposed to be protected by SAE-PK, if the only information it has is the SSID and the key, aka Wi-Fi password?

Evaluate this encryption algorithm !,0,1c4f5ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1c4f5ug/evaluate_this_encryption_algorithm/,71,2024-04-15 01:16:06,"Actually i thought of something very simple based on the following principle:

The function/algorithm which achieves defense against differential attacks must be different from the function/algorithm who uses the key.

Btw, this principle actually exist in AES (so it isn't really something new).Of course, the order in which this functions/algorithms are applied is: first, the one that achieves defense ; second, the ones that uses the key.The difference between this encryption system and AES would be that if the first function is positively provable than there is no need for multiple rounds.First i would choose plaintext size = ciphertext size = key size = 8192 bits.

In my opinion, the second function (the one that uses the key) is pretty boring; basically it can be any function that respects all properties of One Time Pad.Some specific example of such functions are:

1. XOR operation (my preferred choice)
2. modular addition/subtraction

For the first function (the one that achieves defense) i'm thinking about a simple function that flips 4097 bits for each bit changed/flipped inside the plaintext.The starting/default (plaintext ; ciphertext) pair is (000...000 ; 000...000) pair.Btw, it is easier to count the positions from 0 instead of 1.If bit (from plaintext) on the position i is changed/flipped. Than all bits (from ciphertext) from the positions:\[i ; (i +4096) modulo 8192\] closed rangeare changed/flipped.

The question is: What are the weaknesses of this symmetric encryption algorithm (knowing that you can encrypt as many blocks as you want using the same key in ECB mode of operation) ?"

Bob makes a build for Survey Ape and loads it into a custom linux image so that if he puts that image on his own HDD it will load linux and auto-start Survey Ape. He sends that build to Eve to run on her host machine. I think the TPM can be used to assure Bob that Eve is in fact running untampered ASUS hardware. But can the TPM attestations also be used to assure Bob that Eve did not modify the linux image before loading it into the hard drive, perhaps changing Survey Ape to harvest credentials?

Looking for learning resources for CSIDH,14,1bwsq0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1bwsq0y/looking_for_learning_resources_for_csidh/,5,2024-04-05 15:50:35,"Hello, recently I came across ""A Friendly Introduction to Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman"" to SIDH by David Urbanik [(link)](https://www.math.toronto.edu/dburbani/work/friendlysidh.pdf). His explanation was very digestible for a layman like me and gave a very clear overview on how SIDH works.

I'm currently looking for something similar but for CSIDH. Many papers on CSIDH assume too much mathematical background for me which makes it very difficult for me to understand what's happening. Does anyone know of a high level overview of CSIDH that assumes a similar mathematical background like Urbanik's?

Particularly, from what I understand, CSIDH works by commutative group action where the group is isogenies acting on some elliptic curve E0. What I'm confused is:
1. How are the isogenies constructed?
2. How do isogenies even compose and commute: say I have phi: E0 -> E1 and tau: E0 -> E2, how would (phi . tau) even makes sense, let alone being equivalent to (tau . phi), when the domains and codomains don't even match?
3. An extension to 2: what even is the group? I can't convince myself isogenies would form a group under composition since composition doesn't make sense. 
4. Wouldn't algebraic actions like this be suspectable to quantum attacks? Or is it okay for CSIDH specifically because we aren't sending group elements, but rather elements which is being acted on by a group?"

Adapting Hashcat's mul_mod for Multiplication mod N,7,1bhpa9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1bhpa9c/adapting_hashcats_mul_mod_for_multiplication_mod_n/,3,2024-03-18 07:15:57,"Hello! I am trying to perform some EC arithmetic on the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) curve. 

Specifically, I am having trouble performing a modular multiplication using [Hashcat’s OpenCL implementation mul_mod](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/fafb277e0736a45775fbcadc1ca5caf0db07a308/OpenCL/inc_ecc_secp256k1.cl#L593) function.

The function as-written is for performing modular multiplication `mod P`, but I am needing to perform modular multiplication `mod N`. I previously tried to modify the function to use the lib’s `SECP256K1_N*` values, but was not getting the proper result. 

I noticed that the function uses an optimized algorithm from [Modular Multiplication using special prime moduli](http://www.isys.uni-klu.ac.at/PDF/2001-0126-MT.pdf) (p.354 or p.9 in that document), and as such uses a “magic number” from the curve (omega: `0x3d1`) related to the curve’s P value in the internal calculations. 

Is there a straight-forward way to alter this function to perform multiplication `mod N`? Or, is this specific implementation not compatible due to the “special moduli”? If not compatible, can someone help point me in the right direction of an OpenCL compatible mul_mod secp256k1 implementation?"

On top of that, could you guys maybe enlighten me. Is there a reason, why this topic is usually not worthy for an own sub-chapter? Is it a trivial thing or is it just too vague?

Why padding oracles? I am interested in having some literal content, other than the same explanations on the internet. Don't get me wrong, they are good and helpful, but while learning for my crypto exam, I often realized, that I want to go the extra mile.

Regarding the book. I would like for it to be a general book, which also contains knowledge about encryption, authentication, netsec, and IPSEC/DNS(SEC) if possible.

motivation: bank releases a signed document about your monthly transactions. you want to show it to someone, but redact certain fields.

kinda something like this:

bank has a signing key, the public key of it is PUB

the bank signs a document m that is a series of submessages m_1 ... m_n. the bank also publishes S signature.

then i can redact any of the messages, and construct, e.g:

m_1, redacted(m_2), m_3, ..., and a modified S'

anyone with S' and PUB can verify the redacted signature against the redacted m.

it is okay if S' has a totally different format than S.

it should be clear and verifiable which parts are redacted and which parts are original.

the parts must still be linked together. so individually signing parts is not enough.

however, it should not be feasible to figure out any redacted elements, even with brute force. this is important, because m_i can be of a small set, like birth year, or can be guessable, like a suspected recipient bank account number."

I've read the original CKKS paper, and as I understand, with CKKS, we have to use canonical embedding encoding procedures to encode our data into polynomials from Rq, which means that with degree-N polynomials, we can encode at most N/2 numbers. 

I have a couple of questions
 Are there other encoding schemes for CKKS with better encoding efficiency? 
What encoding schemes are used by BGV and/or BFV? What is their efficiency? 
What other encoding schemes exist, and what schemes use them?

One for comparison/authorisation and the second is a key for encrypted data.

Is this a safe use-case?

I personally think so due to the fact the only way you'll get the second hash is if you brute-force the first one which would ultimately mean they have your password.

The most obvious approach seems be to use fully homomorphic encryption, but that is (usually?) a symmetric system where whatever key which can decrypts the output data could also decrypt the input, which must remain secret.

I have some design leeway, and while I prefer a low-communication solution, I might instead be able to use a protocol like MP-SPDZ's `tinier` FKOS15 implementation over a bitsliced boolean circuit -- except that I've tried three different circuits and can't get a test vector to work in any of them. (That part might just be because I suck. Pointers appreciated.)

I'm also tantalized by the idea that the fact that the compression function is itself constructed entirely from simple boolean operations (AND, XOR, NOT, and rotate right) might mean that it's in the set of functions which can be efficiently handled by the method described in [Secure Computation on the Web: Computing without Simultaneous Interaction](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/157.pdf), but I have no idea if I'm barking up a sensible tree there.

Any input would be welcome, from implementation suggestions to avenues for further research!"

if chacha20 keys are guaranteed to be random will that satisfy the no-nonce-reuse rule?,2,1anvof9,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1anvof9/if_chacha20_keys_are_guaranteed_to_be_random_will/,2,2024-02-10 19:07:34,"cross-positing from [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39321117):

currently playing around with X25519/chacha20  (and its AEAD counterpart chacha20poly1305) to do some PGP-esque  encryption stuffs [here](https://github.com/seanwatters/rgp/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L125).

based on my understanding of stream ciphers, ""nonce  reuse"" refers more specifically to ""nonce reuse with a given key, for  different plaintexts.""

basically the thing that i'm trying to  evaluate is whether there is any risk to ""reusing"" a single nonce with a  bunch of keys that are guaranteed to be random.

the process for encryption is as follows:

1. Generate one-time and ephemeral components
    - nonce      
    - one-time content key      
    - ephemeral private key      
    - one-time public key 
2. Sign plaintext to generate content signature
3. Encrypt plaintext and content signature with one-time content key
4. Encrypt one-time content key for all recipients
    - Generate shared secret with recipient public key and ephemeral private key
    - Encrypt one-time content key with shared secret

in the current setup the ""content key"" (think PGP session key) is always randomly generated, and the Diffie-Hellman shared secrets—used to encrypt the ""content key"" for each recipient—are created with an ephemeral/throw-away private key that's also randomly generated (and if you have a duplicated public key in your recipient set, it's still same-key-for-same-nonce-for-same-plaintext so no violation).

additionally, if there was somehow an overlap on a recipient's DH shared secret and the content key (statistically very low likelihood) i'm not sure that there is any additional vulnerability, or way to analyze without having already either gotten the content key or the shared secret, and in either of those cases you're already in.

NOTE: this whole thing is mostly just about saving storage space; ideally just wouldn't have to store an additional 24 bytes per recipient. with benchmarking, the time overhead of generating a nonce for each recipient is negligible."

I'm working on a file hosting service (think s3) one of which's goals is storage deduplixation between clients. Files are identified by their hashes, and currently every client must re-upload the entire file to prove ownership. We're trying to move to a model where files aren't not re-uploaded using some kind of Proof of Retrievability.

Ideas we've come up with:
1. Generate a secret per file at first upload time, and generate an HMAC using that secret and file. Store secret and HMAC. Provide client with secret at upload time to allow them to generate the HMAC and present it as PoR.
2. Classic merkle tree.
3. Generate hash list (basically merkle tree leaf nodes but no tree) and store with file. Request entire hash list as a PoR from client.

Our security team shot down 1 since they thought a shared secret (even though it's on a per file basis) between clients is bad. We decided against 2 because it's too much of a burden on our clients. We're implementing 3, but tbh it just doesn't sit right with me.

Do any of you have thoughts on some kind of alternative PoR that has the ease of use of the hash list or HMAC, but allows each challenge to be unique? Additionally, we ruled server side spot checks or dynamic HMAC secrets since it's too expensive to read from storage.

I came here because I am interested in ZK-proofs, especially non-standard uses. They're nice for L2s in blockchains, but ZK-proofs should have so many other benefits. My real interest is in pushing the limits of what we can do with them, such as using it for fuzzy data (ZK biometric proofs) and maybe even geometric ZK-proofs which could be used to prove flight paths without giving them away. 

Both of those options I'm sure would be quite computationally complex. I guess here's a simple version for flight paths: can we prove that two lines never intersect without giving away what those two lines are? I guess that's the very simplest geometric ZK-proof."
Out of group public key algorithms (good/bad/always/bad?),5,19az8cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/19az8cv/out_of_group_public_key_algorithms/,3,2024-01-19 19:00:32,"I'm an amateur cryptographer and have always been curious why public key algorithms do not venture out of group.  The answer I usually get is that it's much easier to find a solution when the operations are out of group.  I've never seen though the effort to prove to me entirely why.

This example public key algorithm is an out of group RSA variant and thus far does not have any solution that breaks it.

Generate 4 primes not equal (a, b, p, q)

n = p \* q

m = a \* b

t = ((a - 1) \* (b - 1) \* (p - 1) \* (q - 1)

pk = random integer such that GCD of integer and t = 1.

sk = modular inverse of (pk, t)

if n < m swap n and m

Encryption and decryption are achieved with 2 exponentiations.  Encryption m first then n, decryption, n first then m.  Signing and verification are achieved similarly to RSA signing modulus order (m, n) verification modulus order (n, m).

What makes this a good or bad public key algorithm?

I'm currently playing with my [Tkey](https://tillitis.se/products/tkey/), which for our purposes is basically an HSM. Among other things, I would like to use it to sign huge multi-gigabyte files. Unfortunately my beloved TKey has less-than-lovely specs:

- A very slow RV32I CPU running at 18MHz).
- An even slower 62.5K bauds serial connection.

Hashing my 4GiB file on the TKey would take forever, and streaming it would take even longer. What am I gonna do?

## The boring solution

Well duh, don't sign the file, sign a hash of the file instead. And if that's not good enough there's Ed25519ph (Pre-Hash) that can do the job for you, RFC approved and all. There's even [direct support for it in Monocypher](https://monocypher.org/manual/ed25519), just use that and your tiny TKey won't have to hash the whole file.

## The clever solution

No no no, that's not good enough. I want a _pure_ Ed25519 signature, of the _entire_ file. When there's a will, there's a way, so let's try to be clever and [hope for the best](https://monocypher.org/quality-assurance/disclosures).

Hem.

First, a recap of Ed25519. Starting from a secret key `sk` (a random 32 byte number) and a message `M`, the whole signature thing goes like this:

    t1 = SHA-512(sk)[ 0..31]
    t2 = SHA-512(sk)[31..63]
    a  = trim_scalar(t1)         // Secret key
    A  = [a]B                    // Public key
    r  = SHA_512(t2 || M) % l    // Secret nonce (l == curve order)
    R  = [r]B                    // Public nonce
    h  = SHA_512(R || A || M)
    s  = (h*a) + r
    -> R || s

As for signature verification:

    assert(A is on the curve)
    assert(R is on the curve)
    assert(s < l)
    h = SHA_512(R || A || M)
    assert([8*s]B == [8*h]A + [8]R)

The first problem with Ed25519, is how signing requires _two_ passes over the file. My TKey's puny 128Kib won't hold my 4GiB file, so not only do I need to hash it twice, I need to _stream_ it twice. But you'll notice that the first hash has one purpose and one purpose only: deterministically generate a random nonce between 0 and the curve order. The main reason for the determinism is to avoid the dreaded ECDSA nonce reuse, and be immune to bad RNG. The TKey has a good RNG, so let's rely on that:

    t2 = random(32 bytes)
    r  = SHA-512(t2) % l

_(Note that I don't trust my TKey to generate perfectly unbiased random bytes, so I use a hash to smooth out any irregularity.)_

Now I only need one pass:

    h = SHA_512(R || A || M)

Note how this is derived from public information only. It has to be, since that's the hash used for verification down the line. Which means I can compute it on my host laptop, which got gigabytes of memory and gigahertz of speed. How about doing just that?

    TKey:
        r = SHA-512(32-random-bytes) % l  // Secret nonce
        R = [r]B                          // public nonce
        -> r

    Laptop:
        h = SHA-512(R || A || M)
        -> h

    TKey:
        t1 = SHA-512(sk)[0..31]
        a  = trim_scalar(t1)              // Secret key
        s  = (h*a) + r
        -> s

    Laptop:
        signature = R || s
        assert(signature is valid)

So it looks like it works, right? Well…

## Is it secure?

It clearly is secure against eavesdropping, because only public information ever goes to the wire (except when you sign private files, but that's out of scope). Potentially more worrying is a compromised client or full blown MitM. My TKey is supposed to act as an HSM, so I need to guarantee it won't leak its secrets even if I get ransomwared by the NSA and KGB combined.

Note here that we have exactly three pieces of private information inside the TKey:

- __sk:__ the Ed25519 secret key.
- __a:__ the actual secret key (enough to forge messages).
- __r:__ the secret nonce.

The TKey outputs 2 pieces of information we could use to trigger a leak:

    R = [r]B
    s  = (h*a) + r

That is, the signature itself. Which is okay as long as `h` is legitimate, but a compromised client would actually have full control over `h`. So what if we replace `h` by some malicious value?

    s = (0*a) + r = r
    s = (1*a) + r = r+a

In the first case we leaked the secret nonce r. Which would be catastrophic if we could trick the TKey into reusing that nonce, but making sure the TKey uses each nonce for at most one signature is easy. I'm more worried about the second case. Sure, if we have only one it is quite clear we cannot disentangle `r` and `a` from just knowing `s`. But what if we try this several times?

    s1 = r1+a
    s2 = r2+a
    s2 - s1 = r2 - r1
    ...

You get the idea. I _think_ this kind of shenanigan is not enough to recover information about `a` (because of the similarity with stream ciphers), but I'm still afraid I might be missing something.

Hence my question: __is my scheme actually secure, or is there a way to get secrets out of my TKey from a compromised laptop?__"

Difficulties in understanding reduction functions for rainbow tables,12,191i9zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/191i9zv/difficulties_in_understanding_reduction_functions/,6,2024-01-08 04:32:59,"I would like to understand exactly what the reduction functions in Rainbow Tables are all about. I understand the basics of the purpose of a rainbow table and how a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-2) works and which properties it has.

I keep stumbling over the vague description of the required reduction function. My understanding about rainbow tables so far has been:

&#x200B;

* I have a list of many possible passwords (P)
* For each of these passwords p from P, I first calculate the hash value `h(p)` and then reduce it using a reduction function r. The result is a chain of length 1. This can be repeated many times to get longer chains
* The result of a chain of length 1 for the first password in my list is: `r(h(p_1))`
* The reduction function is usually chosen in such a way that it maps a relatively ""long"" hash value to a value that corresponds to the domain of the original password list P. So `|h(something)| > |r(something)|` and `|r|^character_set` is approximately as large in bits as the number of passwords in P, right?

So far so good. Now, however, this value r is hashed again at some time in order to be able to generate longer chains.

If I assume that the hash function h is a one-way function, I don't understand what information is gained here. If I hash a value y that is only minimally different from value x, the resulting hash value for cryptographic hash functions changes by 50% on average (avalance effect). So how can I gain any additional information from `h(r(...))`?

I can´t see the benefit from a rainbow table since i don´t get how a further hashing of a somewhat arbitrary reduced previous hash gives me any advantage since any input to a hash function that is different than the original will give me something completely different what looks like random-ish."

1. As an example, if given a 256 bit hash function, I assume that there is a 1-1 mapping of all 256 bit inputs to different 256 bit hash functions.
2. For inputs longer than 256 bits, the hash value of all possible inputs of the same length provides a uniform distribution over the 256 bit hash space.

Now I know it is not practical to brute force test these assumptions. Are these true? and if so, is there a fundamental property of hash functions that forces this?

Universal hashing misunderstood?,16,18leu5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/18leu5m/universal_hashing_misunderstood/,38,2023-12-18 11:52:39,"As a developer of a hash function - \`komihash\`, a fast non-cryptographic hash, I was thinking about figuring out how to prove that it is ""universal"". But I've stumbled upon some sort of a block in undestanding...

Universal hash function's collision estimate is commonly defined as N/M, where N is the number of unique keys, and M is the capacity of a data structure (or hash output, if a hash-map is used). For example, in this lecture: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect1004.pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect1004.pdf) or on Wikipedia, but there it's much harder to read.

However, as I know from practice, collision estimate for all modern hash functions, from non-cryptographic xxHash to cryptographic SHA and Blake is (N\^2)/M/2. This can be seen in SMHasher tests.

So, the question is - what an ""acceptable"" universality proof should prove - N/M or (N\^2)/M/2? N/M can probably be seen in CRC32 or some linear mappings, but these are not considered ""state-of-the-art"" hashes, and I can't prove this for \`komihash\`. Proving the latter can probably be done via birthday paradox and correlation reasoning as \`komihash\` is basically a pseudo-random permutation with validated high-quality PRNG performance.

EDIT: it was my misunderstanding - N/M relates to pair-wise collisions. While (N\^2)/M/2 is set's total collisions estimate, unrelated to isolated pair-wise collisions, and is not defined in ""universal hashing"".

EDIT2:  I've just found an answer myself. If a data structure is filled with values from S iteratively, one by one value, and each addition causes N0/M collisions on average, where N0 is the current number of values in a data structure, then the integral of the number of collisions from 0 to N0 is N0\^2/M/2, for ""universal hash function"", and it cannot be anything else."

I'm from IT background but I know very little about cryptography.

&#x200B;

Issue: I'm new to Cryptography. I've been trying to learn cryptography for quite a long time. I joined many courses so far from University to paid courses, the issue with many of these courses is

&#x200B;

The way they teach is stuck on single Powerpoint slide and speak the whole lecture which is very boring, non interactive. The professor or teacher in other courses assumes the student knows it all and skip definition of many things.

&#x200B;

The solution I'm looking for is :

Is there any course out there (from verified sourse not any random youtube video) that teaches cryptography from the scratch, just for beginner, at a very basic level, and teach in an interactive manner like using animation.

&#x200B;

**\[ Update \]**

I couldn't understand the long courses (I attended many of them) which aimed at beginners but they explained cryptography terminologies in brief in just 1 sentence and move on..

Then explain different encryption without explaining in detail what the basics are and also without explaining, the terminologies in detail for ex: I attended a few courses that just went off my head.

&#x200B;

So I decided to attend the Introductory course but I'm yet to find the one I'm looking for, I'm sure I'll get that. I prefer paid course as they tend to add value and I'm open to attending more than one (if you've any suggestions).

&#x200B;

FYI: At present, I don't want to go for practical things as I first want to understand the very basics, literally elementary level basics (to go up to beginner level) so that I can understand. Once, I found a course that aimed to children but it was too short and ended in 7 mins.

&#x200B;

I just want to learn the very basics in very easy to digest manner like:

history of cryptography and 

followed by different ways of cryptography, 

how it's used (for ex different types of encryption) in a very easy language and with interactivity as I mentioned earlier.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone know what I'm looking for? Thank you in advance 🙂"

Does my research proposal make sense?,11,18dztif,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/18dztif/does_my_research_proposal_make_sense/,5,2023-12-08 17:30:39,"Hello, I'm seeking opinions for my PhD research proposal related to cryptography and type theory. My idea is to create a framework in Agda (a proof assistant) for universal composability proofs. This is largely motivated by the fact that most cryptographic proofs aren't rigourous and is on paper. If there is a framework for mechanizing UC proofs then we can guarantee that the proofs are actually correct with a lot less effort, and also ideally lower the entry for people who want to formally proofs their protocols are secure.

My university happens to have a lot of experts in formalizing pi calculus, so my plan is to:
1. Formalize ""interactive polynomial time turing machines"" with pi calculus in Agda
2. Make some helper lemmas and functions to help with actually doing UC proofs
3. ???
4. Profit 
5. Maybe try to actually use it by translating some proofs from paper to Agda, like the OPAQUE proof

My questions are:
1. Are there communities online that are experts in universal composability proofs? It would help if there's a Zulip / Discord / Slack group where I can ask more in-depth questions.
2. I know there are people in University of Boston who are also trying to mechanize UC proofs with EasyCrypt. That said I haven't tried EasyCrypt at all, so I don't actually know how it works. They said they needed to create a DSL specifically to reduce boilerplate code, so I'm guessing EasyCrypt's expressiveness isn't that good and perhaps a more expressive proof assistant like Agda would be a better choice. Does it make sense to try to mechanize UC proofs in Agda when there are already people doing this with EasyCrypt? 
3. Somewhat related to (2), but if anyone here knows EasyCrypt would you mind sharing your experience using EasyCrypt to formalize cryptographic proofs? How difficult would you say it would be to use EasyCrypt to model more abstract stuff like simulation based proofs?"

Using hash generated from other hashes as key?,6,187zbz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/187zbz6/using_hash_generated_from_other_hashes_as_key/,3,2023-11-30 19:30:56,"Hi.

Right after going through introduction to cryptography, I'm putting it into practice, mainly to learn.

For instance, I wanted to try out cascading encryption.

I was using ascon and XChaCha20-Poly1305 (as an introduction to fast/lightweight algorithms).  The keys for both are generated just before use, from hashes, say, user password hash, combined with hash of something else.  I used argon2 to get the hashes (extracted the actual random thing from inside of what argon2 generated).  The two hashes are joined by addition, say, in python, hash1+password\_hash.  The result is hashed with ascon.hash with ascon-xof, to get a final hash, which is to be used as key

`key = ascon.hash(hash1 + password_hash, ""Ascon-Xof"", 64)`

Key is never saved anywhere. Neither is user password hash (or password). For hash1, either the actual hash, hash1, is saved or some random thing, from which hash1 is to be generated, is saved.

The question is about key generation. For each, ascon and xchachapoly, different hash1 are combined with the same user password hash, (say, ascon\_hash1 + phash, xcp\_hash1+phash), to generate different keys of required lengths.

Is generating key like this bad? How bad?

The question actually originated when I was about use an actual KDF, HKDF, and figured it is going to be pain in the moola if I use any more libraries. But if the above is stupid, I will use actual HKDF.

Ps. I'm still learning, the above is not for real world project but a prototype.

Rant: Not published? Not secure! (FHE edition),13,183ntd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/183ntd6/rant_not_published_not_secure_fhe_edition/,8,2023-11-25 10:46:30,"Like some of you I first heard about ZKSnarks in 2012 and was floored. It might have been first realized in 1985, but to see it practically explained and ready for implementation was mind blowing *(I mean, all cryptography is basically wizardry anyway!)*. I immediately jumped right behind it and followed everything about it. I was able to read the paper, understand some of it, and see the building consensus amongst researchers as to its efficacy. The open discussions were illuminating.

Around that same time I learned of the new applications of forward secrecy in communications protocols too, like OMEMO or Signal. Cryptography was killing it! Solving problems, saving lives, helping people through transparent research and open source application of number theory – this is what makes it all worth it!

Then in 2018 I heard about some improvements in homomorphic encryption and immediately fell in love. It was basically promising the ability to perform computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. That’s huge! Of course everyone around me said *“That’s just theory, there’s no way it will work in practice. It’s decades away, if ever”*, but it was open source, research was continuing transparently, and you could understand that even though there were differing approaches / schemes, everyone wanted it to work for the benefit of everyone and there was a lot of passion for it.

The recurring theme to the positive effect of these advancements in cryptography and applied cryptography that I'm talking about here were that they were made possible because of open, published research, and transparent, open source applications. We all know that while being open doesn’t guarantee something is secure, being closed kind of guarantees it can’t be.

This applies to all cryptography of course, but as FHE is just now starting to really explode, I feel it’s important for us to demand substantial evidence or peer-reviewed research of any FHE solutions. The complexity of FHE makes it challenging for non-experts to distinguish between legitimate advancements and fraudulent claims – even for other cryptographers who aren’t studied in FHE –  so we as a community need to speak out as we have done before with *“not your keys? not your crypto.”* except now *“not open? not secure”*. You don't need to be an expert in homormophic encryption to know that someone claiming ""*it works, but you have to trust me*"" or ""*watch this demo but we can't show you any code*"" isn't good enough.

Everyone here knows this and I'm preaching to the choir, but I feel like it can't be stated enough so I wanted to make this post. We really should demand tangible evidence supporting any claims made about FHE products or technologies, and we should demand they allow independent verification of their efficacy and security. The research behind it should also be made public and subject to peer review.

We all care about cryptography and the promises it holds for protecting and advancing communications and information and thus civilization as a whole – that’s why we’re all here – but ""*Not published? Not secure! ""*"

QUIC  offers multiple streams per connection but my understanding is that  within each stream, there is still head of line blocking, so all we’ve  done is moved multiplexing from the client port number to the QUIC  stream number. We can reuse handshakes but for repeat clients, we  already have a 0-rtt handshake with TLS 1.3?"

I was looking at this xkcd and I was wondering if there was some mechanism Wikipedia could use to select a version of the article with an attached proof that they didn’t know the word count of the article.

One option might be to publicly commit to two candidate articles with different parity, and some publicly verifiable future random event.

How could that latter problem be solved? How do you toss a coin and prove you only tossed it once? It’s important that if you use a third party to generate the coin toss, you can verify that they only tossed the coin once."

JWT with associated data,6,17qod5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/17qod5e/jwt_with_associated_data/,2,2023-11-08 09:41:31,"Let's say you have to use JWT and have a JWT library that you trust. Now let's say you want to use additional data when verifying the JWT in a manner similar to an AEAD. This additional data should not be disclosed by the JWT. And this is not supported by your basic JWT library. How would you do that?

Encoding the associated data with [PAE](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/docs/01-Protocol-Versions/Common.md#authentication-padding) seems like a good first step. 

Then it's possible to include a hash of this encoded associated data to a ""aad"" field within jwt data (in the payload probably). Verification then comports two steps, first verify that the JWT is properly signed using the library, then verify the associated data hash in that JWT. But I dislike that we've now split our security verification in two steps that depend on each other, even if I can't find a way to exploit it at the moment. It feels error-prone.

It also discloses a hash on the associated data, which isn't desirable if it is composed of guessable information. This is fixed either by adding a nonce to the associated data (but now we also need a new ""aad-nonce"" field) or using a HMAC with a server secret instead of a regular hash for the ""aad"" field. Having a server secret goes against many uses of JWT so it's probably not a great idea.

If the JWT signature uses HMAC instead of RSA, then we can maybe include the associated data in the key. Something like: hmac_key = pbkdf(pae([associated_data] + [hmac_secret])). But that approach gives some amount of control over the HMAC secret which is the foundation of our security in this JWT scenario, which isn't great. And it's impossible if RSA is used.

So all in all it seems the best is to add two fields to the JWT:

* ""aad-nonce"" with a nonce
* ""aad"" with SHA384(PAE(associated_data))

followed by a two-step verification.

What do you think? Do you know of any library that proposes associated data natively with the JWT? Do you see any flaw in that design?

I'd like to say that this is just to play around, but I'm currently looking at code that tries to do JWT with associated data in an obviously broken way so I'm trying to see if it's feasible to fit a replacement in an existing architecture or if deeper changes are required."

Looking for advice on building inline radio encryption solution,8,17dkmul,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/17dkmul/looking_for_advice_on_building_inline_radio/,4,2023-10-21 22:58:21,"I have recently decided to begin working on a radio project that I honestly have no idea where to start on. I currently have no real knowledge of programming, encryption, electronics, radio (beyond signal propagation fundamentals), or any other concepts and/or processes required to see this project through to final development of a functional product/prototype. I would also like to note that I am interested only in building this and NOT buying a commercially available device of comparable capability. This is primarily to ensure personal control over functionality and develop a fundamental understanding of all processes involved in the project.

The concept is an inline encryption/decryption device that is intended to be connected to a digital radio. On the transmitting end, it should take the voice transmission from the digital radio, encrypt it, and then transmit it over RF. The receiving end decrypts the transmission and forwards it to the connected radio. This is intended to allow the end user to dictate their own encryption methods for digital radio rather than relying on manufacturer encryption standards.

I would like to eventually expand this device's capabilities and make it able to send encrypted text and other data over radio as well. I would like it to be capable of functioning as a standalone device when transmitting text, but must require connection to a radio to transmit voice.

Unfortunately, I do not even have limited knowledge to start with. I know nothing of the concepts or skillsets required to begin creating such hardware and am seeking advice or even assistance on where to start. I may even be willing to make the final product open-source or seek partners/codevelopers in the development process.

Please understand I am only seeking advice and assistance regarding tackling this project. I am not interested in the opinions of Sad Hams who will argue ""legality"" of encrypted signals on amateur radio frequencies. This is not intended to be used on amateur radio frequencies.

Any help will be greatly appreciated."

&#x200B;

I'm aware we work in a cyclic subgroup of curve25519 for obvious reasons, the curve is composite order, with groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, q, 2q, 4q, 8q.

&#x200B;

1, 2, 4 & 8 are obviously tiny and useless.

2q, 4q & 8q are not interesting as composite and can be attacked with PH.

&#x200B;

I think that the reason we clamp the key is to ensure we are always using a key that is a multiple of 8 so we always end up working in q.

&#x200B;

A few questions:

&#x200B;

1. If we always used the regular G as generator, we would always end up in q anyway right? (even without the key being a multiple of 8), so this only matters for ECDH, where maybe G is not the only point used for scalarmul?
2. does this mean that the actual valid private keys are literally always multiples of 8, i.e. 8, 16 ... 2\^252 - so all keys between 1 and 8 would yield the same public key? (appreciate in reality we use 32 byte keys, but hypothetically) if your private key was: \`\`\`0x0000000000000...1\`\`\` or \`\`\`0x0000000000000...7\`\`\` you'd get the same pub key after clamping + scalarmul, right?
3. If 2 is true I guess this is ok as q is really representing only 1/8th of the points on the curve?

This was prompted after reading [How the Great Firewall of China Detects and Blocks Fully Encrypted Traffic](https://gfw.report/publications/usenixsecurity23/en/).

Are there implementations of censors where they've implemented inspecting traffic and performing point distinguishability of strings for a putative handshake and not considering the traffic a concern if it is indistinguishable from random?"

Could we build PSPACE-based cryptography - more secure post-quantum?,4,16o627w,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/16o627w/could_we_build_pspacebased_cryptography_more/,2,2023-09-20 23:12:09,"It seems not safe to exclude possibility of e.g. some next generation quantum computers being able to attack NP problems (e.g. [2WQC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13522)) - so maybe it is worth to start thinking of shifting the cryptography breaking difficulty into the next class - still practical polynomial space: [PSPACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE)?

Assuming having **hypothetical [NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_\(complexity\)) solver**, we could ask it ""for what cryptokey, deciphered prefix is not a noise"" - in theory being able to break not only e.g. RSA, but also symmetric ciphers ... the question is how to design more difficult cryptography requiring hypothetical PSPACE solver instead for such potential attack?

**[PSPACE-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE-complete)** are e.g. **SAT with added forall** general quantifier, many puzzles and **games** ... in theory we could make e.g. M2M authentication such a game.

There are also interesting **[reconfiguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconfiguration) problems** - as search for a path satisfying some constraints - what resembles sequential decoding popular in error correction, and could be dependent on cryptographic key (e.g. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.5317 ).

Is PSPACE-based cryptography discussed in literature? Could we build some? How? Any other potential protections against hypothetical NP solver? (generally I would gladly discuss/collaborate)"

Grad School & Isogeny-based crypto,10,168ixgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/168ixgr/grad_school_isogenybased_crypto/,3,2023-09-02 19:41:14,"I’m a pure math undergraduate in the US applying to grad school this semester (and starting my search perhaps a little late… oops). I’m interested in mathematical cryptography, including the theoretical design of cryptosystems and the study of mathematical problems that are related to or “one step removed” from cryptography, e.g., in algebraic number theory and algorithmic number theory. That said, there are basically no faculty working in cryptography at my university—hence my focus on pure math instead—and so I’m turning here for domain-specific advice.

I have a few questions, and would really appreciate any insight anyone in the field could give, even if only on one of the questions.

1. Does anyone have recommendations for programs and/or particular professors to look for? From my searching it seems that relatively few researchers in mathematical cryptography (in academia) are in the US, whereas I’ve found many in Canada (Waterloo, mainly) and in Europe. There are a few I’ve found in the US—Kirsten Eisentrager (Penn State), Katherine Stange (CU Boulder), some at USF and FAU as well, and some more junior faculty at Virginia Tech. Are there any other particularly notable programs I should consider besides these? (Or any of these I shouldn’t really consider?)

2. To what extent does the overall academic reputation of the grad school matter if my goal is to pursue a career in research? I know that in principle what matters is your research, but I’ve also heard (more informally) that it can sometimes be difficult for hiring committees to completely ignore where someone did their graduate work, and that has made me (perhaps wrongly) a little wary of places like FSU and FAU. 

3. Would it be a bad/risky choice to go into isogeny-based crypto now, given the attack on SIDH from last year? Or is it still an active area of research that’s attracting funding?

Thanks very much for reading! And if anyone has any other advice/comments unrelated to these questions (or related to questions that I should have asked but didn’t), I would very much appreciate those as well."

What are the use cases for VRFs?,11,1609koo,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1609koo/what_are_the_use_cases_for_vrfs/,2,2023-08-24 13:11:28,"Just came across this RFC for VRFs - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9381.txt

At the outset, I thought, it's meant to reduce the over all TCB in a security protocol? For example, we can do the keyed mac verification using a public key and so don't have to establish the key for it. However this uses asymmetric key crypto and so doesn't quite into what I described above. Also the performance won't meet the symmetric key based protocol/computations. 

From the RFC -- ""A key application of the VRF is to provide privacy against offline
   dictionary attacks (also known as enumeration attacks) on data stored
   in a hash-based data structure.  In this application, a Prover holds
   the VRF secret key and uses the VRF hashing to construct a hash-based

Novel Hash Based PoW Key Exchange,4,15wrkas,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15wrkas/novel_hash_based_pow_key_exchange/,1,2023-08-20 19:12:39,"Hey everyone. Long time lurker and security buff with a hobbyist specialization in cryptography. To put it in perspective, I've studied secure coding and practiced proper implementation of cryptographic primitives (i.e., how to handle a password, various algorithms, salting hashes, CSPRNG vs PRNG, and things on that level). I've only just come up with this idea in the last couple days so please excuse a few potential errors. This is not a finished system. Also, all of this is written on mobile from memory.  Please let me know if I went off the wall somewhere and I'll review it.  I mainly want to get opinions and discuss my approach using hashing and PoW as a key exchange algorithm. 

With the goal of securing a connection (tunnel) from point A to point B, I have been developing a rough draft proof of concept that will allow both parties to mutually exchange a set of secrets as proofs of work. As with DH, this is susceptible to a MitM attack. It's important to note that this is designed to establish a mutual, genuine interest in the secure connection, but only guarantees the integrity of the connection. It will limitedly ensure confidentiality, but only if the first few handshakes aren't recorded and solved by a bad actor.  This means that a connection can be intercepted after the fact with no repercussions, but an attacker with logs of the entire exchange session will be able to solve the PoW and create a MitM-like scenario

The handshake works by forcing both parties to brute force the hashes of randomly generated values to arrive at unique proofs of work. They are effectively authenticating each other's interest in creating this session.  They share the completed proofs and, if valid, they continue brute forcing in segments until both secrets are complete. 

Each party generates a unique, random secret S and hashes N bytes of S before exchanging the result. Ideally this will include a random salt, integration of connection details into the hash, and timestamps.  The mutual challenges are passed if both parties return valid hashes of the (ideally modified) plaintext solutions. This repeats for all bytes in both secrets. As N increases, so does the computational cost of the handshake (256^N hashes max with 256^N / 2 being the average hashes needed to solve the proof for N-byte chunks). 

This process expends time and energy to make eavesdropping costly to an attacker. It also reinforces the relationship between points A and B since they are both performing work to support the connection.  A MitM would have to do twice the work to arrive at the same secrets. 

Even with full knowledge of the parameters, the attacker would need to perform the same brute force attacks as the legitimate parties. There is no way to coerce the secrets without solving the hashes. Again, I know anyone with knowledge of the full session can perform the same work (perhaps more easily) but the same potential exists with DH as well. If an attacker tries to do this across multiple sessions, they will be expending that much more energy to breach just one layer of security. This can be further enhanced by adding a static number of hashes to be done on the final step, and/or using a memory-hard hash function like scrypt. 

This is my first post and entirely on mobile so cut me a little slack lol. Thanks!"

Proof of human craft cryptographyc signature,1,15tr9a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15tr9a8/proof_of_human_craft_cryptographyc_signature/,5,2023-08-17 10:46:19,"Ignoring if something like this exists or  if it’s being developed, I was wondering about this idea:

A signature attached to an image (or other) file, that proofs that the image was created by human craft.

The signature should be able to verify that the image was created by a human considering how much work was done within some creation software using some verified hardware and how much intervention from other sources the image had (like copy from external source into the image).

Since my knowledge  about crypto is almost non existent, here is a rough and clumsy description: creation software (like krita) could have an add on that “records“ all movements within the software and hash it so it can be used to verify the  how the work was done. This signature should also consider a hardware key implemented within creation hardware like wacom in a way that the only way to fake the image using machines is to have a robotic arm trained to behave like a human and spend the time a human will take to create the image, holding a stylus and using a wacom tablet painting in krita in a way a human would.

Do you think it’s applicable? Can someone with a better understanding about crypto give me a more accurate description about how it could be accomplished from a technical point of view or point me where I could study about systems like this?"

Trouble detecting cyclic group order crossovers in SECP256K1,7,15c7nvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/15c7nvu/trouble_detecting_cyclic_group_order_crossovers/,0,2023-07-28 15:04:43,"There's a problem in detecting whether the sum of public key addition has crossed the cyclic group order boundary

For this example, think of public keys **Pub** as private keys **Priv**, (private scalars), one-way converted to points on the elliptic curve.

**n** \- is the order of the group. Private keys can range from 1 (the generator point **G**) to **n−1**.

**n−1** is the maximum size (integer value) of a private key, and it is also the number of all non-trivial points available on the curve.

The order **n** itself produces the point at infinity **n ∗ G = O**. Adding points further, just starts the curve over again.

As each public key has its own corresponding private key, that corresponding private key lies within certain ranges of powers of 2.

The order itself lies within: 2^(255) < **n** < 2^(256)

Suppose that we have a public key **Pub** that corresponds to the private key **Priv** whose range is known. Like: 2^(a) < **Priv** < 2^(b)

Before using a certain formula, we need to create 2 arrays

1. An array of 256 public keys. Each public key will represent a private key that will be powers of 2 ranging from 2^(0) = 1 (the generator point) to 2^(255)

2) Another array of 256 public keys, with each public key representing private key that contains: 1 + (1 over the power of 2 ranging from 2^(1) to 2^(255)  ). Note: B\[0\] is going to be 1 + 1 = 2. Like:

https://preview.redd.it/900rsg2xjqeb1.jpg?width=669&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc602453daa684fbd642d7b4079ea5af00a99d43

The formula allows us to do this:

Imagine we have in addition:

2^(a) < **Pub** < 2^(a+1)

2^(b) < **A\[b\]** < 2^(b+1)

If **a = b** then:

https://preview.redd.it/6boqk6cdyqeb1.jpg?width=298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3f2dbe22fc59cf9971b8a4bca5fe4b2e436a03d

If the **Pub+A\[b\]** hasn’t crossed the n boundary, the result should be 1 or 2. Otherwise, it has crossed the n boundary

If **a > b** then:

https://preview.redd.it/bd8hu61jyqeb1.jpg?width=824&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d47ae5febc2d94a2c2acd82154925d8b89520f7a

Let's review specific examples (Had to use links for some images):

1. a = b ([https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0EOb.jpg](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0EOb.jpg))

Imagine if we have a curve of order of n = 33 151. 2^(15) < 33151 < 2^(16)We'd like to add 67. 2^(6) < 67 < 2^(7). However, if the addition result of 2 public keys is bigger than the order of the elliptic curve, the count starts again. We could have our original private key to be **n − 1 = 33150**. Hence, **33150 + 67 => 33217 − 33151 = 66**

Let's apply the formula. In other settings:

However, in settings of our elliptic curve, 33150 + 67 becomes 66

We didn't get an expected result, and hence we detected a cyclic group crossover.

But in practice it doesn't work. I've been experimenting with SECP256K1 additions. For example, if we take **n − 1** as our original private key converted to public key then:

When **(n − 1) + 3** we'd get a public key of **2G**.

Have no idea why.

In other words, why does the method work with decimal (normal) arithmetic, but with ECC additions, it doesn't? Is there any way to fix it?

By maximal degree, I assume he means that the opening time depends on the size of the Reference String - the tuple size depends on the highest degree of the polynomial you want to commit. 

I understand the KZG commitment scheme & it's opening but I couldn't figure out why opening time would depend on this.

Lets design a provably collision-free hash function.,4,14rgual,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/14rgual/lets_design_a_provably_collisionfree_hash_function/,21,2023-07-05 12:09:55,"The pigeonhole principle dictates that any collision-free hash function will produce an output digest whose length in bits is equal to the length of the input message.  Whatever function we implement, H(M), will be a bijection, and therefore any output digest `D=H(M)` will uniquely determine its paired input M.   

The properties of our H() which we desire are security, arbitrary input length, and a good avalanche effect.  Security means it is prohibitive for an attacker to surmise the message M, given its digest.  Avalanche effect means any small change in M results in a catastrophic amount of change in the bits of the digest.   Finally, arbitrary input length means that the length of M determines the output length -- in our case, exactly so.   

The uses of such a hash function are numerous :

+ You run a company that issues prepaid cards of some kind or another. Every card must have a unique access ID number, but consecutive access IDs give no indication of what IDs could occur in the future.  The IDs should be unpredictable even if many hostile customers horde thousands of cards and collude with each other.

+ You run a website with user-uploaded content.  You must automate the file names in your database of uploaded files, but in such a way that all filenames are unique.  You might desire the next file names are consecutively *unpredictable*  , to avoid directory crawling or other abuses of your system.

+ You need a substitution table for largeish words.  A bijection function is mathematically equivalent to a substitution table over words. If your word size is 32 bits, a substitution table would be a file of 16GB. Worse, if you have a word size of 64 bits, the table could never be stored on earth. Instead, you can use your collision-free H() to calculate this table ""on-the-fly"", on a word-for-word basis, without the need for storing the entire table.  You simply input your word into the function and it calculates the ""substitute"" word forwards. 

It may come as surprise that off-the-shelf cryptographic hash functions offer no guarantee of resistance to collisions. In many contemporary algorithms, it is merely anecdotal that no collisions have ever been found.  In contrast, the collision function described here is *provably collision free.* However it will utilize some famous hash functions internally. 

For brevity, we will denote the hash function CFHF(M), operating on input message M.   CFHF is best described for very long M first, and then modified to its shorter versions, which are significantly more complex. We will impose a simplifying constraint, that M must come in specific whole number of bytes. So CFHF has arbitrary input length, provided the input length is a multiple of 8 bits.   A final constraint is imposed that the smallest input length is 16 bits. Generally the input size is unbounded above.


# Large M

For larger M exceeding 64 bytes,  CFHF is mostly trivial.  We remove the leading 512 bits of M and set it aside.  The remaining portion is concatenated with a secret key , K.   This concatenated string is taken through a known hash function that outputs 512 bits.      The output of the hash is XOR'd against the leading bits of M set aside from earlier, and then slapped onto the end of the output block.    The remaining portion in the input (after the leading) is a copy , unmodified, at the beginning of the output block. 

The above procedure repeats recursively in several rounds, eventually where the final output block is the digest of CFHF().    

This large M case is shown in the following diagram over one round : 

https://i.imgur.com/thC2Qri.png

The corresponding pseudocode 

	-------------------------------
	|| ; concatenation operator
	M  ; message 
	""Mn"" ; denotes the nth iteration of M. Same length as M.  
	K  ; secret key .  the zero byte if not desired. 
	Hs() ;   SHA512 , WHIRLPOOL or similar. 
	rounds <-- 6  ;  (discuss?)
	for n <-- 1 .. rounds : 
		V <-- first 512 bits of Mn
		R <-- trailing bits of Mn after 512. 
		T <-- Hs(  R||K ) 
		Mn <-- R || (T xor V)  
	D <-- Mn
	Output D
	-------------------------------

While SHA512 is chosen here, any can be used (WHIRLPOOL, Skein, etc).

# Collision free? 

A heuristic proof that CFHF is free of collisions is to run the following algorithm on many (message,digest) pairs produced by CFHF.  The following pseudocode will recover M exactly given only its output digest, D.   

Note this procedure assumes the length of M exceeds 65 bytes.

    ------pseudocode of inverse function of CFHF()----
	|| ; concatenation operator
	D ; digest from CFHF above. 
	""Dn"" ; denotes the nth iteration of D. Same length as D.  
	K  ; secret key matches CFHF above.  
	Hs() ;   SHA512 , WHIRLPOOL or similar. 
	rounds <-- 6  ; (discuss?) 
	for n <-- 1 .. rounds : 
		V <-- trailing 512 bits of Dn
		R <-- leading bits of Dn not containing V 
		T <-- Hs(  R||K ) 
		Dn <-- (T xor V) || R 
	M <-- Dn
	Output M
    -------------------------------

Since M is always exactly recoverable starting from a digest alone, we argue (heuristically) that  the hash function must be a bijection.  Bijections are not merely collision *resistant* -- they are by definition free of collisions entirely. 

We turn to the discussion of whether CFHF really is collision free but in the mathematical sense.   We note that if SHA512() is chosen for Hs() , that there is no guarantee of collision resistance.  

Indeed, it must be the fact that collisions will occur in T, as the secret K key was concatenated to R.   It turns out this does not matter.  To prove this to the reader,  simply substitute a static T in the above algorithms. Substituting a constant T would correspond to maximal collisions in Hs(). Literally all inputs to Hs() collide.   Notice that M is still fully recoverable from D.   

Thus we conclude that  CFHF is still collision-free,  even when Hs() is not.


# Medium M

A medium length M is  17 bytes up to 64 bytes in length.  This special case is required as the chopping of the leading 512 bits leaves nothing left in the trailing section.   Given that the key K is still concatenated, we still implement SHA512, but then use MD6 to ""compress"" the digest.     Now instead of chopping 512 bits on a leading section, we chop 128 bits instead.  

A diagram of one round is shown here :

https://i.imgur.com/FHgp6Xg.png


# Small M 

As before,  the procedure of chopping off 128 leading bits will degenerate when the entire input message is less than 128 bits.   Some other procedure must be used.  CFHF() becomes most complex in this regime of inputs, and a block cipher is recruited in one of the steps.    Instead of chopping off a fixed-length leading section,  we now partition M into two left and right halves of equal length. This is always possible since M's length is constrained to multiples of 8 bits, and has an even length.

The diagram for one round is shown below :

https://i.imgur.com/2Pz2qSW.png

Some brief words on the decision to include a block cipher here.  It was required that the trailing bytes undergo a compression function.  The computer science literature is saturated with variations of how to 'hash' a larger string to a smaller one, due mostly to an abstract data structure called a *lookup hash table.* Those procedures were serious candidates here, as in this regime we may have M messages which are only a handful of 6 to 10 bytes or so.    However, those procedures are woefully insecure in the cryptographic sense.  

We opted instead for a different approach. This proceeds by first expanding the trailing bits to a 128bit block, via MD6.  This block is then subjected to a block cipher and then literally truncated by taking the first j bits and discarding the tail.  The reader may note that this procedure is technically implementing (what could be called) an arbitrary-length *compression function.*  For tiny M of 2 bytes, a block cipher is overkill. But this is the price paid for generality. 


# Implementation 

Constraints are imposed on CFHF() for simplicity. Input message must be in bytes, and the smallest message allowed is 2 bytes.  As far as the question as to how many rounds are suggested, the answer would nominally be six rounds.   Technically the number of rounds required is a convoluted function on the length of M.  These complications are simply academic.  A simple, straight answer is sufficient : use six rounds.    


# Weaknesses

For any designed hash function,  the desired avalanche effect has that if a single bit is changed in M, then (roughly) 50% of the bits change in the output digest. 

CFHF  exhibits a ""weak"" avalanche effect for extremely long M.  The reader may have noticed that if M is longer than say,  1600 bits,   then if a single bit is changed in M, the number of bits that change in the digest is maximally 512 bits.  Their location may even be identifiable in the digest.  This number then remains flat for M's longer than 1600.  

It may be that increasing the number of rounds heals this weakness.  It is not clear whether this is true in practice, and this space is ripe for research."

If you have 64 bits of address in a 256 bit field, would it not make sense to use an offset unique to each key?  That way, nobody uses the exact same set of indicies and multi-target resistance is improved by some measurabe amount. 

I may be completely incorrect, and I left out the levels and different address types for simplicity.

After reading this my understanding is that signing is probably necessary if you are going to backup your secrets file to a cloud provider. Because otherwise they could just completely replace your file and you would never know.

The article also talks about something called **signcryption** and mentions how no popular tool does it. The author claims this is necessary because combining signing and encryption is hard.

I am not really sure I understand the above statements because this should be applicable to GPG also right? Does GPG have the above problems?

Can I simply use AGE and maybe another signing tool like SIGNIFY to do what I want as an alternative to GPG?"

Novel (?) hash-based encryption algorithm (not signatures),4,1471ykt,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1471ykt/novel_hashbased_encryption_algorithm_not/,22,2023-06-11 13:54:05,"I implemented a custom encryption algorithm, encrypt-gib ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibgib/encrypt-gib), [github](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib)), and am looking for feedback (beyond don't create custom encryption algorithms). It is entirely open source, the existing readme explains the basic algorithm, and I am currently working on improving documentation that explains the stronger version (to help mitigate against short-circuit brute force attacks). I would be thrilled to give more info and answer questions, including my opinions on the nuances of the implementation.

After many hours of searching patents, the approach is novel AFAICT, though I have been able to find one existing patent, [""Message encryption using a hash function"", 1993, Kaufman & Perlman, DEC](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5483598A/en), that uses recursive hashing for dynamic creation of 1-time pads. There are key differences, let alone the lack of parameterization and configurability in the patent. Most of these differences rely on the knee-jerk reaction that the algorithm is ""inefficient"" as it operates at the hex level (i.e. not binary), when IMO the definition of ""efficiency"" always depends on the use case. My particular use case is to minimize complexity to be friendlier to our emerging DLT infrastructure and the future of smart contracts (though it's not directly related to cryptocurrency!). Also I offer it as an alternative to existing post quantum approaches for diversification, though of course that would require cryptanalysis beyond my current abilities. At the very least, it should be trivial fun for people who enjoy examining algorithms.

As for some of the other requirements before posting, I have certainly been aware of Kerckhoffs' principle for decades. Schneier's Law is newer to me but seems I imagine to be born of practicality with moderating forums above all else. I am not saying my system is unbreakable - far from it. That's why I'm looking for constructive external feedback, in good faith and friendly, from those with more cryptanalysis experience than me, including help pointing me to prior art.

## algorithm tl;dr

The [encrypt-gib readme](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/main/README.md) has a better walkthrough, but the fundamental idea is that instead of working at the binary level we work at the hex level. We encode the plaintext into hex, and then we use mostly recursive hashing to create ""JIT alphabets"" (similar to on-demand 1-time pads) *and substitute the character with its corresponding index into its alphabet.*

## example output

## weakest stream cipher

Here is an example of the weakest form that enciphers character by character.

With the encrypt-gib repo cloned and using node v20 (v19+ required b/c I use `globalThis` for easy isomorphic Web Crypto API usage):

    node . --encrypt --data-string=""foo"" --output-path=""./bar"" --strength=""weaker""

So `""foo""` is the plaintext, this will write to a file called `""./bar.encrypt-gib""` and `""weaker""` specifies a relatively arbitrary set of weaker parameters. Using the password of ""bar"", this produces the output in `bar.encrypt-gib`:
    {""encryptedData"":""3,2,8,16,89,9"",""initialRecursions"":1000,""recursionsPerHash"":2,""salt"":""3dcf8b601d59509f5608323d00d5077929a70544e17f9a5fb47cd7093b145704"",""saltStrategy"":""initialAppend"",""hashAlgorithm"":""SHA-256"",""encryptedDataDelimiter"":"",""}

_Note that it first hex encodes the plaintext, which is why there are more numbers in the ciphertext than characters in the plaintext._

## stronger multipass parameters

The most obvious weakness with the stream cipher approach, even with a higher number of initial rounds of key stretching (`initialRecursions`), is that it would be relatively easy to brute force offline if you know the shape of the beginning of the plaintext. For example, if you know it's a JSON object, then the first character should be `""{""`. When guessing, you don't need to decrypt the entire data, just the first couple characters should suffice.

To help mitigate this, I implemented a [""multipass"" mode](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/90cec1697863db4a1cd987df3d8231f3e2b7a5c1/src/types.mts#L124). When used in combination with an [`AlphabetIndexingMode`](https://github.com/wraiford/encrypt-gib/blob/90cec1697863db4a1cd987df3d8231f3e2b7a5c1/src/types.mts#L61) of `""lastIndexOf""` and a ""sufficiently high"" pass count, this creates a couple interesting dynamics. It forces the decryption to work over the entire section, as each 1-time alphabet is only extended once per section pass. So if there are 3 passes and 3 hex plaintext characters `""abc""` in the section, the alphabets would be built A, B, C, AA, BB, CC, AAA, BBB, CCC. So there is a relatively high probability that the last index of `""a""` will not be in the first hash digest alphabet. This also has the interesting quality of placing the alphabet-building phase in memory, creating a possibly memory-hard algorithm.

## thanks

There are many more implementation details of course, but I feel I've already written more than enough here. Of all the research I've done, I can say that this has qualities *like* those involved in many existing systems, e.g. a Feistel network. But the only thing to my eyes that looks really close is the ""Message encryption using a hash function"" patent, though again that works at the binary level. The fundamental reason I like this particular approach is that it leverages cryptographic hashes as a whole to reduce and/or concentrate complexity. For just one example, this turns out AFAICT to mitigate against timing attacks ""for free"". But since this works at a high level, it obviously has a performance bloat. I'm wondering if further cryptanalysis by experts would show that it is fundamentally flawed or that it would be a big, slow - but effective - cousin of the new encryption algorithms out there.

Thanks for your time."

Mnemonikey | Determinstic PGP key recovery using phrases | v0.0.1 prerelease published,44,143fu2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/143fu2y/mnemonikey_determinstic_pgp_key_recovery_using/,1,2023-06-07 10:10:49,"[I have published my first ever tagged release of Mnemonikey,](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/releases/tag/v0.0.1) a novel CLI tool and Go library which allows PGP users to derive their PGP keys deterministically from a seed which is exported as a phrase of 14 words for easy offline backup. This works much in the same way keys for Bitcoin wallets can be deterministically derived from a recovery phrase.

As far as I'm aware, Mnemonikey is the first of its kind, rhyming only with the related but conceptually different [`passphrase2pgp` tool](https://github.com/skeeto/passphrase2pgp), from which I drew my original inspiration.

This first release marks a point which I feel is suitable for a v1 release, but before that I'd first like to send out some feedback requests in various communities to ask for final feedback and, for those most interested, testing of the library and/or CLI tool.


[Y'all were extremely helpful when I made my initial feedback request](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/zoezpt/mnemonikey_determinstic_backup_and_recovery_of/), and by now the ripest fruits of that feedback have been implemented. Notably:

- [The seed and creation time is hashed with Argon2id before deriving keys, to reduce the feasibility of a batched brute force attack.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/19)
- [The epoch has been bumped to New Year 2023.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/24)
- [We are now using a custom 4096-word list](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/26). This allows for denser encoding, and provides word-to-word distance guarantees.
- [Added support for password-encrypted recovery phrases.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/28)
- [Added a `convert` command to convert recovery phrases between encrypted and plaintext formats, and to change the passwords of encrypted phrases.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/33)
- [Added a script to construct static, reproducible builds of the `mnemonikey` CLI tool.](https://github.com/kklash/mnemonikey/pull/36)

Basically I'm reading [this paper by the NTRU Prime team](https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/latticerisks-20211031.pdf) and in section 2.5 it's explaining how cyclotomic fields should be replaced with prime degree fields with ""big Galois group"", namely because how structures within cyclotomic fields (e.g. subfields and automorphism) can potentially lead to an attack in the future, it then states ""Fields with big Galois groups are far from having automorphisms.""

This sentence confuses me because to my understanding a Galois group is the group of all automorphisms in a field extension, so wouldn't a ""big Galois group"" imply having a lot of automorphisms? 

It also goes on to state how NTRU Prime field has a Galois group of size p!, whereas NTRU field's has size p-1. How exactly does the size of the Galois group correlate to security of the KEM?

I'm excited to introduce you to a project I've been working on in the past weeks: Sequency.

Sequency is a lightweight C++ library that makes generating random numbers effortless. Whether you're designing a game with unpredictable elements, or a simulation that requires robust randomization, Sequency is can empower your project.

**Project:**

 I wrote Sequency with the intent of creating a very easy-to-implement and light PRNG library. As we can see, there are crypto libraries like OpenSSL which make everything too overly complicated for simple applications; Sequency is designed to be simple and effective. 

**Contributing:**

Contributing to Sequency is super simple, in fact, my initial intent was to have a lot of people contribute to it for its semplicity. So yeah! I'd really really really like contributions, whether they're new algorithms, documentation improvments, code comments or anything else!

I'd love to see people contribute to my project with complicated PRNGs like  Rijndael or MARS in CTR, ISAAC, Fortuna or any other algorithm!  
Feel free to contribute, suggest, or criticize my work!

For more information about Sequency and how to use it, you can check out the project on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/JoshuaKasa/Sequency).

How to find the key matrix? Hill cipher,4,13pvodf,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/13pvodf/how_to_find_the_key_matrix_hill_cipher/,6,2023-05-23 12:55:28,"Hello,

I have a question. I need to find the key matrix that was used to encrypt the message and decipher its content. I have the following information:

&#x200B;

1. The encrypted message.

Does anyone know if there exists online a collection of actual Enigma messages, together with their decryptions?  I've found perhaps half a dozen examples online, mostly taken from salvaged submarines. 

I'm organizing a cryptography course, and I thought it would be a good exercise to write a simulation of the Enigma machine (any variant will do), and students could test their results by attempting to decrypt real messages.  I'd have to do this myself, ahead of time, which would also be interesting for me.

Ideally, such a collection would contain enough material to build a statistical model of the plaintext, and for the students to try to find effective cribs.  It would also be nice to have at least a few messages of historical importance, and not just a long list of weather reports.

Does anyone know if such a collection exists?"

I just did the prompts.

 I looked at the right two passages and noticed they had the same pattern I then looked and saw it was a vigenere cipher. I asked chat gpt if it had the ability to work a vigenere cipher and it said it could and I had it do a frequency analysis.  They key it gave back after a frequency analysis was ""KRYPTOSISTHEKEY"".  I asked it to apply the key and I got back this response. ""BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENCEOFLIGHTLIESTHENUANCEOFIQLUCKIERSTILLISTHEHIDDENAGENDAOFTHECIPHERSINTERPENETRATINGSYMBOLS""

There is more information I do not know if this correct I just thought I would share this since it could be more information to the first passage. 

If you want to recreate this I prompted by  Vigenere cipher  and not saying its about Kryptos and had it treat it like a random cipher.  I first did identify and then frequency then asked to find the key off frequency then applied the key. 

""

I can certainly try! Based on the frequency analysis of the ciphertext, we can make educated guesses about the most likely letters used to encrypt each column. Here are the most likely letters for each column:

* Column 1: ""K""
* Column 2: ""R""
* Column 3: ""Y""
* Column 4: ""P""
* Column 5: ""O""
* Column 6: ""S""
* Column 7: ""T""
* Column 8: ""A""
* Column 9: ""I""
* Column 10: ""C""
* Column 11: ""H""
* Column 12: ""E""
* Column 13: ""R""
* Column 14: ""O""
* Column 15: ""S""
* Column 16: ""A""

Based on these guesses, we can construct a potential key as follows: ""KRYPTOSISTHEKEY"". This key has a repeating pattern of length 13, which corresponds to the length of the key used to encrypt the message.

This is a quote about the columns and the key it formed for reference to other people."

To bring people up to speed, I got this question in my examination and I tried brainstorming it but couldn't figure out how the question was supposed to be solved with those 4 constants.

I asked my professor about it and turns out, all we needed to do was make a 2x2 Matrix using those constants, mod 27 it and then round it off to get integers. I don't think the question was clear about this instruction. I was wondering if we could come up with some absurd algorithm along the lines of hill cipher which uses those 4 constants to generate a 4x4 random Matrix and use that for hill cipher?"

Why is the use of Lagrange Bases in PLONK considered a big innovation?,14,136698p,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/136698p/why_is_the_use_of_lagrange_bases_in_plonk/,2,2023-05-02 20:12:14,"Why is the use of Lagrange Bases in PLONK regarded as a major innovation? 

The L in PLONK stands for Lagrange & I have seen videos & tweets by both Ariel Gabizon & Zac Williamson where they emphasise this particular aspect of PLONK - that it uses Lagrange Bases. 

I think PLONK's predecessor SONIC didn't use Lagrange Polynomials. However, SNARKs older than SONIC like Groth16 or Pinocchio do use Lagrange Interpolation to convert R1CS to QAP. In both Groth16 & Pinocchio, if your solution vector is of length `s` & your circuit has `g` gates, then you use Lagrange Interpolation to create `3s` polynomials each of degree `g-1` in the process of converting the R1CS to the QAP form.

So why so much fuss made about PLONK's use of Lagrange Bases? What am I missing? 
Another thing which makes me think I am missing something they emphasise the Lagrange ""base"" part rather than talking about the interpolation. But the Lagrange Base is just a part (the first step) of the Interpolation process."

For privacy reasons I want users to be able to create decoy accounts by registering a throwaway public key. I could instruct users to create a key pair normally, and then to discard the private key.

I'd like to create a helper system that would allow users to create decoy accounts in bulk. The user would need to trust this system not to keep private keys. If it's possible, I'd like to find a way to create a public key without actually creating private keys. I'd document that process, open source the code, and then run it on the helper system. In my use case, I expect some users to be able to trust that the helper system isn't running different code, generating private keys, and stealing them.

A naive approach would be to just create something that looks like a public key, but is actually just randomized. I'm concerned this would create a weak key, like an RSA key that can be factored really easily, or something that's easy to detect as a decoy because the structure is unusual. That would fail to meet the security or privacy requirements

How much secure is my UDP based network protocol?,31,12yg97k,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/12yg97k/how_much_secure_is_my_udp_based_network_protocol/,24,2023-04-25 06:14:31,"I implemented a minimalistic reliable UDP network library (designed for real-time uses like games, but also for generic virtual p2p connections), and I would love to hear any feedback on the potential design flaws of my protocol.

The cryptographic library used is libsodium.

I use AEAD encryption for the confidentiality and integrity of the session message data (xchacha20-poly1305) and naturally public key cryptography for the session keys exchange at the start of the connection.

All keys are 256 bits (32 bytes), and all nonces are 192 bits (24 bytes). For the session nonces, I just increment the nonces as counters, and I know how much to increment because I use a sequence number for every message fragment (I dont' even send the nonce). I read from libsodium website that there is no pratical need to change session keys with xchacha20-poly1305, so I don't renegotiate session keys.

Naturally the problem is the actual exchange of session keys and nonces at the start of the connection. When a connection is accepted by the ""server"" (let's use the server-client for better describing a peer connecting and another accepting connections), I generate the symmetric session keys and nonces server side and send them to the ""client"" if the conneciton is accepted. I assume the client knows the server public key, and I use throw-away identities for encrypting the session keys in order to have some form of ""perfect forward-secrecy"" (the nonces are encrypted too even if not strictly necessary).

The protocol for initiating a connection is very minimalistic, and is composed of just 2 messages: a client request and a server response (or silence if the request was declined).

&#x200B;

Client side (connection request):

1. Generate client identity if necessary
2. Generate client throw-away (""ephemeral"") identity
3. Generate a message composed of plain data and encrypted payload: (client\_public\_key | random nonce | Encrypt\_server\_pk\_client\_sk( timestamp | ephemeral\_client\_public\_key | \[padded 0s to increase size to maximum payload size \] ))

The client\_public\_key is there because the server will need it to decrypt the payload, the nonce is randomly generated for every request. The timestamp is used for discarding old connection requests, and the padded zeros are there because it is a way to prevent the server to be exploited in some form DDOS attacks against other targets (I read it is good manner to make packet size request always > packet size response).

&#x200B;

Server side (connection response):

1. Decrypt client payload with client public key and server secret key to retrieve timestamp and ephemeral\_client\_public\_key.
2. Check timestamp to discard old requests.
3. Generate server ephemeral/throw-away identity.
4. Generate 2 random session symmetric keys and 2 random nonces (send and recv keys are different).
5. Use the client ephemeral identity and server ephemeral identity to encrypt the session keys and nonces.
6. Send the message to the client: (server\_public\_key | random\_nonce | ECRYPT\_client\_pk\_server\_sk( ephemeral\_server\_public\_key | encrypted\_session\_keys\_and\_nonces ))

&#x200B;

The client checks that the server public key match the stored one, and then try to decrypt the payload. If decryption is succesfull, it has all the information necessary to decrypt the session keys and nonces using the ephemeral identity of the server.

Is my protocol reasonable enough or I made some dangerous mistake I'm not aware of?

Suppose that I have a password p. From this, I want to derive new passwords. I calculate p1=hash(p-1), p2=hash(p-2), etc. This is trivial password salting with a counter and hashing (or a challenge response, like HMAC-SHA256(p, counter), where the challenge is a counter, perhaps a short random PIN that I can write down). Nothing fancy.

Since hash is one way, knowing p1, p2, … doesn’t tell anything about p. Also, if p is strong, say it’s a 256 bits key, brute forcing any of these passwords is not an option. Since p is 256 bits, I don’t care about slowing down key derivation using a fancy KDF such as Argon2 or PBKDF. If p is kept secure, p1, p2, … are secure.

Is there any problem with generating new passwords in this trivial manner? I just need to secure one password (for example, store it in HSM and do the hashing inside HSM)."

AES 256 GCM - Crytpographic Reason to Rotate Key?,37,12g0r53,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/12g0r53/aes_256_gcm_crytpographic_reason_to_rotate_key/,10,2023-04-08 17:38:14,"Hello! I have a performance and cost vs rotation frequency tradeoff that I'm trying to balance. I've been so far unable to find concrete information about risks of key reuse that would let me choose an evidence-based tolerance for how much key reuse is still cryptographically secure.

Let's say I have an arbitrary number of AES 256 GCM ciphertexts that were encrypted using the same key but a unique and random IV for each. Excluding side-channel attacks, is there a known attack that could take advantage of the repeated key use to help me get the plaintexts? How many repeated usages are needed before the attack becomes feasible?

Let's also say I obtained the corresponding plaintext for many of the ciphertexts via other means. Could having a multitude of ciphertext/plaintext pairs help me decrypt other plaintexts? Similarly to above, how many would be needed?

I'm aware there are other benefits to key rotation such as limiting blast radius if a key is exposed. In this case, I'm trying to more clearly understand whether there are also cryptographic reasons to limit key reuse."

Real World Cryptography - exercise Chapter 7,10,122wwew,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/122wwew/real_world_cryptography_exercise_chapter_7/,5,2023-03-26 14:36:00,"Spoilers below.

In Real World Cryptography, Chapter 3.3.4, the author explains how MAC tag comparisons can be vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks. Essentially, the attacker guesses each possible value for the first byte of the tag, and when the verification routine takes the longest, this means the first byte is correct. 

Then, Chapter 7 has the following exercise (7.1):
> As you saw in chapter 3, authentication tags produced by MACs must be verified in constant time to avoid timing attacks. Do you think we need to do the same for verifying signatures?

The solution given at the end of the book is:
> No. is is because the verification of an authentication tag involves a secret key. Verifying a signature only involves a public key and, thus, does not need to be verified in constant time.

Does anyone else think this answer is a bit unclear, and maybe slightly misleading? When an attacker uses the timing side-channel attack, they're not attacking the secret key of the MAC scheme, but rather the MAC tag itself. In my opinion, the answer makes it sound like signatures are safe from these attacks because the public key is public. 

I feel like a better explanation would be that MAC schemes and signature schemes are fundamentally different in how the MAC tag/signature is verified. Because MACs are symmetric cryptography, verification involves recomputing the MAC tag and then comparing it with the provided MAC tag. Whereas signatures are asymmetric, so verification is a completely different operation which generally doesn't involve any comparison. Of course, this does indirectly link back to secret keys vs public/private keys.

Am I missing something here?"

There might be also some metadata, such as email address. 

But other than that, is there any risk with publishing public keys on internet? 

Put in another way, does a public key reveal any information that could help an attacker in any way? 

Perhaps those familiar with details of different types of asymmetric keys could comment on potential attacks on public keys."
Is permutation-based crypto not catching on in the wild?,28,1208h1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1208h1b/is_permutationbased_crypto_not_catching_on_in_the/,20,2023-03-23 23:03:16,"Permutation-based crypto is an approach to building symmetric-key cryptographic schemes defined by a pseudorandom permutation and a ""construction"" that uses the permutation, where the scheme is provably secure as long as the permutation satisfies certain properties. As far as I understand this makes it easier to trust the resulting schemes as safe because a single ""good"" permutation gives credibility to many potential schemes that use it. (Not a cryptographer.)

Permutation-based schemes seem to have taken over the cryptologic world by storm. Very quickly after the introduction of the Sponge construction around 2006/2007, many of the competing submissions for the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function contest were based on a sponge and a permutation, and indeed, Keccak (by the inventors of the sponge) won the competition. Some years afterwards, permutation-based submissions similarly dominated the CAESAR and the NIST Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) authenticated encryption competitions. In the meantime various variants on the sponge construction were introduced (duplex, donkeysponge, monkeyduplex).

Furthermore, it was apparent that permutation-based crypto offers a drastically simpler way to build an entire symmetric cryptography system with most of the implementation code reused compared to previous approaches. For example, to achieve authenticated encryption with the ChaCha20 stream cipher, one would usually pair it with the Poly1305 MAC. Permutation-based crypto, on the other hand, allows a single algorithm to be both a hash-function, extendable output function (XOF), MAC, and authenticated stream cipher. This makes permutation-based crypto look like the natural choice for implementing symmetric cryptography systems.

To paraphrase a paper by Daniel J. Bernstein et al (Gimli), a permutation being a better unified primitive than a block cipher seems to be a new conventional wisdom.

The sponge construction is inherently sequential, which was problematic for achieving competitive performance on modern computer architectures (because they enable parallel computation in multiple ways). This is why, ten years after the Sponge construction, the Keccak team published the Farfalle construction, a sort of parallel counterpart to the Sponge: https://keccak.team/farfalle.html

However, after all these (and other) developments in cryptology (perhaps even a revolution?), it seems that permutation-based crypto is still almost unused in ""the wild"", with no sign of this changing. Am I right about this?

I guess that the Keccak permutation may be too-slow to be competitive in all cases, and the other ones aren't yet vetted enough to be considered safe? Is it merely a matter of time until the permutation-based crypto revolution translates into the world of programming and network protocols?

Am I missing something?"
Hiding documents inside video files?,7,11zuqih,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/11zuqih/hiding_documents_inside_video_files/,8,2023-03-23 14:34:22,"I'm new, so pls don't hate too much

I've been wondering how hard it would be for an untrained person to steal internal company documents by hiding their contents inside a video file, uploading that file to youtube, and then allowing some 3rd party to download it with a youtube video downloader.

Can be done in an obvious way, just has to be viewable as video. Doesn't have to be anything crazy, like making the video look normal, it's fine if the video looks like a mess.

I tried to do it myself by tinkering with renaming, writing and converting mp4, txt and gif files. I failed.

The reason why I'm interested, is because tinkering with files that you already have on your PC, as well as uploading the video to youtube is undetectable by IDS systems (they are like antivirus programs, but for network traffic for the whole company). The only thing an IDS would notice is that a lot of data was uploaded to youtube, but it wouldn't be able to tell what it was, because the communication is encrypted. There also wouldn't be any way to know which account the person used to do it.

If you're worrying about what I'm going to do with this information, I work in cybersecurity and I'm just interested."

For a bit of context: I'm making a program for encrypting passwords stored in a password manager with an additional per-account key got from an external device.

The ciphertexts will be manually copied around by the user, so I want them to be as short as possible, especially since encoding them to ASCII adds another 25% of overhead. Also, malleability doesn't seem like a concern. What are my options?
  
If I used a stream cipher, I'd have to use a fairly big nonce to prevent the catastrophic consequences of nonce reuse. I'm instead considering using CBC with ciphertext stealing, since I think the worst consequence of IV reuse here would be that an attacker could tell if two passwords start with the same string - which doesn't seem concerning for randomly generated passwords. I could thus probably get away with a very small (1-byte), or possibly even no IV. Am I correct in this thinking?"

I'm pleased to announce that OpenFHE has been accepted to GSoC 2023 under the NumFOCUS umbrella (see [2023 project listing](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/2023/ideas-list.md)). Our proposed projects are listed on our [wiki](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/wiki/GSOC-2023) but TL;DR we're hoping to expand the library's reach by providing SDKs for  

- iOS
- Android

and we're hoping to create a backend for [HEBench](https://github.com/hebench), which is an open-source framework for profiling various FHE libraries.

You don't *need* to have a background in FHE, but it might be helpful. We're mostly looking for strong programmers who are interested in learning more about FHE and getting their hands dirty.

# About OpenFHE

**What is FHE**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the secret key.

**What is OpenFHE**: From [our github page](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development): OpenFHE is an open-source FHE library that includes efficient implementations of all common FHE schemes:

- Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
- Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
- Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic (includes approximate bootstrapping)
- Ducas-Micciancio (DM) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (CGGI) schemes for evaluating Boolean circuits and arbitrary functions over larger plaintext spaces using lookup tables

I am trying to learn certain aspects of more modern cryptography. As a way to learn, I chose to do a simple CLI tool to encrypt data (like a file) to a PURB using a public key (think something like Age, but producing PURBs and with less functionality). This tool is obviously not for production use (unless someone volunteers to audit it, lol).

While I understand how it can work for symmetric crypto, I am looking to ultimately add public key cryptography to the tool. In this case, for PURBs to remain PURBs, I will need to use some procedure to make the key material look like uniform randomness as well.

I've taken a look at obfs4, because they do something similar to what I want, and they are using [Elligator 2](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4/blob/master/doc/obfs4-spec.txt#L154) to make their key exchange look like random data. I've also heard of it being used elsewhere for similar purposes. I've then tried to look for libraries that implement this functionality. I am primarily focused on Golang, so that's where I started to look. For example, I found this library: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto#Point.SetElligator](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto#Point.SetElligator), but I was unable to understand their documentation, because I do not know some of the terms they use. I also tried to look for Lizard encoding and found nothing.

Another library that I took a look at is Monocypher: [https://monocypher.org/manual/elligator](https://monocypher.org/manual/elligator). Their documentation is much easier to read, but I am still confused, because they use yet another set of terminology compared to the Go library.

This is not in any way an attempt to say that these libraries are bad, they are certainly oriented at people who know what they are doing while I certainly don't, but I would love to learn about this stuff. Can you please give me some pointers where I can learn what all the terminology means, and how the different parts of these systems interact together?

Thank you!"

"Monocypher 4.0.0 is out: full Argon2 support, safer signature API, and more",42,11ds4im,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/11ds4im/monocypher_400_is_out_full_argon2_support_safer/,0,2023-02-27 18:45:09,"[Download](https://monocypher.org/download/), subscribe, bell, money — wait…

I know this may not be appropriate, but this particular release is kind of important. The main reason for this release is because, like many other libraries out there, its EdDSA signatures API was [prone to catastrophic misuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/vfl2se/initial_impact_report_about_this_weeks_eddsa/). And now it's fixed.

_<rant> I will quickly note that this class of vulnerabilities could have been avoided if the original authors of NaCl had prominently explained why they put the private & public halves together in the same private key. The fact that not doing so could be just as catastrophic as a nonce reuse should have been noted in the original Ed25519 paper. Instead many of us found ourselves thinking the NaCl API was kind of ugly, and went on separating the private & public halves because it looks cleaner, or is more flexible. </rant>_

There are lots of little changes, and a few big ones:

- Full Argon2 support. Argon2i, Argon2d, Argon2id, multiple lanes. (Multiple lanes are for compatibility only, they don't actually use multi-threading). And the code got simpler to boot. I will likely ask the IETF/CFRG to add it to the RFC.
- Safer EdDSA API. Now private keys are 64 bytes, and include their own public half. Manual says don't split those halves, or else.
- EdDSA now behaves exactly like the Zebra library.
- Replaced the incremental and custom hash EdDSA API by a proper set of low-level functions.

The last two deserve a bit more explanation.

---

First the Zebra compatibility. Monocypher now uses the batch verification equation (that ignores the low-order components of the points it checks), non-canonical encodings are permitted, and low-order points are permitted. Of course, Non-canonical S encoding are still forbidden, we don't want malleability. My reasons for this choice are best explained in [Henry de Valence's post on the subject](https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am).

The choice of accepting low-level points can seem surprising, given that other libraries, most notably libsodium and parts of Dalek, chose on the contrary to forbid them. I initially thought of following the RFC, but I ran into a couple problems:

- The RFC gives you a choice between the batch equation *or* the strict equation.
- The RFC forbids non-canonical encodings, which are a pain to check for. Well, at least they only affect low-order points…
- …which are _allowed_ by the RFC.

Now I understand why almost no one conforms to the RFC. So I've chosen to be maximally permissive instead. That way I'm sure to accept any signature that is considered valid by another library (except TweetNaCl, which does not check for malleability), in particular those who perform batch verification, whose speed up can't be ignored. Also, accepting low-order points & non-canonical encodings is just simpler. Sure we could ban them, but this wouldn't increase security one bit: recipients need to validate the public keys they receive anyway, otherwise attackers could just provide their own key.

---

Second, the low-level API. This whole endeavour started from someone asking me to implement Ed25519ph for them. I initially warned them that I was relatively expensive, and tried to steer them to cheaper alternatives. They paid up. And so I worked. And that work gave me a deeper understanding of some low-level aspects of EdDSA, and the idea for a new low-level API emerged. Without this job you probably wouldn't see this new API today.

So. I used to love my incremental and custom hash API but it was complicated, somewhat error prone, and quite rigid. So I took the opportunity of the major release to replace it by this simpler and more flexible idea I had:

* One function to trim scalars (clearing 4 bits and setting one).
* One function to reduce 64-byte numbers modulo L (the order of the prime order subgroup of the curve).
* A mul-add function (modulo L).
* A fixed based scalar multiplication (with a trimmed or untrimmed scalar).
* A ""check equation"" function.

Turned out that from those, it's pretty easy to implement various EdDSA variants, including something like an incremental API, an API that uses a hedged nonce (composed of a hash of the message *and* a random component), or an API closer to ECDSA for users who don't want to hash the message twice (not implemented nor encouraged in the manual for obvious reasons), or variants of EdDSA, such as Ed25519ph (implemented as an option), or XEdDSA (exemplified in the manual). And of course the custom hash ability, which I needed to implement EdDSA-Blake2b and Ed25519.

Note the odd one out, `crypto_check_equation()`. It's pretty high level, but it turned out to be enough. The main advantage there is that users have only *one* verification to make. Once they've hashed the relevant input they just give it the public key, hash, and signature, and it takes care of everything, including key validation. I'm very glad to see this ""low-level"" verification API being mostly foot-gun free.

Another advantage is the flexibility in the implementation: I'm not bound to the double scalar multiplication, and can explore various trade-offs. Which I will_ eventually, there are plans for an ""embedded"" edition of Monocypher, tailored for smaller chips such as the Cortex M0."

Encrypting e-mails in my database in a deterministic and secure way: is it possible?,19,113zb3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/113zb3j/encrypting_emails_in_my_database_in_a/,5,2023-02-16 13:49:19,"I would like to improve the security of my app. My app is already end-to-end encrypted but I would like to add another level of security on the server side.

One idea I'm experimenting with is peppering data by encrypting them with secret keys stored only in ENV variables.

I can easily do that with data that I don't search. Since I don't search them, I can generate a random nonce for each encryption.

My problem is doing that with e-mails, since I need them to be searchable. So I need the encrypted e-mails to be deterministic and secure.

Right now my approach is to reuse the nonce to keep the encrypted e-mails searchable. I'm using Libsodium's XChaCha20-Poly1305 to encrypt.

Is it possible to encrypt e-mails securely while keeping them searchable in the database? What library can I use to do this in JS?

Thank you."

"Using ""sedutil"" for SSD hardware-encryption on Windows non-operating-system SSD drives",3,112io1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/112io1d/using_sedutil_for_ssd_hardwareencryption_on/,0,2023-02-14 16:54:40,"The following questions are about using hardware-encryption on Windows non-operating-system SSD drives via ""sedutil"".

&#x200B;

We are fully aware that using hardware-encryption on a Windows operating-system drive (""C:"" drive) is much more complicated and requires setting up a PBA, etc.

&#x200B;

So, all of the questions are assuming that the main operating-system drive (Windows ""C:"" drive) is not hardware-encrypted, and only the other non-operating-system SSD drives (""D:"", ""E:"" and ""F:"") are hardware-encrypted using ""sedutil-cli.exe"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(1)

When using ""sedutil"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives on Windows (not Linux), is Sleep (S3) supported?  In other words, can a computer with ""sedutil-cli.exe"" unlocked non-operating-system drive(s) be put to ""Sleep"", wake from sleep and no problems with using those hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drive(s) as such?

&#x200B;

The main ""sedutil"" github page says that Sleep (S3) is not supported, but it is unclear to us whether they are referring only to Linux or to both Linux and Windows:

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(2)

If the answer to (1) is ""NO"", then does this mean that only Windows hibernation is supported when using ""sedutil"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives?  Or is Windows hibernation not supported either?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(3)

If Windows hibernation is supported using ""sedutil-cli"" hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives, then consider the following simple use case:

&#x200B;

Suppose we used ""sedutil-cli.exe"" to unlock sedutil-hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives ""D:"", ""E:"" and ""F:"" - and those hardware-encrypted non-operating-system drives are in use by applications and/or are even running applications.

&#x200B;

Then, we put the machine to ""Hibernate"" - the machine is now in a fully powered-off state.

&#x200B;

We turn the machine back on - the machine loads the contents of RAM from the hibernation image file (""C:\\hiberfil.sys""), and resumes the operating-system and all running applications - supposedly to the same state as the computer had been, right at being set to hibernate.

&#x200B;

Are drives ""D:"" ""E:"" and ""F:"" still unlocked, functioning and usable without crashing any applications and without any other issues?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only information we have on using ""sedutil"" on non-root (non-operating-system) drives are from the following wiki, but most of the sedutil docs are linux-only and do not really explain how to make hardware-encryption work with sleep/hibernate/etc. on Windows: 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Self-encrypting\_drives#Encrypting\_a\_non-root\_drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Self-encrypting_drives#Encrypting_a_non-root_drive)  (slightly helpful but outdated)

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Encrypting-your-drive](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Encrypting-your-drive) (not very helpful to us because it only explains the more-complicated setup of PBA for operating-system drives.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(4)

Upon reading the manual, ""sedutil-cli.exe"" provides a very non-intuitive user-interface with complicated command-line-arguments that are very difficult (at least for us) to understand:

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Command-Syntax](https://github.com/Drive-Trust-Alliance/sedutil/wiki/Command-Syntax)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It is definitely not as simple as using the BitLocker CLI which is as simple as:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For hardware-encrypting drive F: with password-protector - should be instantaneous since hardware-encryption, unlike software-encryption, is instantaneous:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -on F: -ForceEncryptionType hardware -Password

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For locking drive F:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -lock F:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For unlocking drive F:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -unlock F:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For checking status of all drives:

&#x200B;

manage-bde.exe -status

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If someone could provide the equivalent commands for using ""sedutil-cli.exe"" to do all of the tasks above, that would also be greatly appreciated."

I want to get expert's opinions on implementing security and brute-force resistance to PBKDF2. The project is a desktop database (no cloud - local storage) application that CRUDs proprietary sensitive data. 

First, my threat model warrants that offline attacks are the most concern. Should someone steal the database, I want resistance. I am less concerned about online attacks.

I chose an on-the-fly design. Data is encrypted/decrypted as it is read/written to the database. With that said, I am responsible for securing the backend. Not the DB system. So here are some questions, give the context.

Note:  Assume all encryption is AES-256 CBC mode. I wasn't concerned with offline attacks until I read about modern gaming GPU stacks cracking tons of passwords in a single day. 

1.).  PBKDF2 - Does simply using PBKDF2 to lengthen a key prior to AES256 provide enough entropy to be practically impossible to crack? I know the rounds are used to make computationally expensive. The problem is, I must keep rounds 500 - 1000 to meet performance requirements. 

2.) What relationship exists between rounds of PBKDF2 and brute forcing raw cipher text? People say that lengthening your user password to a KDF is far more efficient than increasing rounds. OK. So why don't I just hash the password or lengthen it somehow before inputing into the KDF? Because all that did was simulate a single KDF 'Round/interation' ?

3.) Is it acceptable to use PBKDF2 or another KDF as a hash function for authentication? Just curious. I've seen mixed discussion on this.

The Citadel Protocol now offers a Remote Encrypted Virtual Filesystem (RE-VFS) feature with post-quantum security integrated into the protocol. This will allow clients, peers, and servers to use each other as remote storage endpoints using virtualized file directories. Additionally, this improves security for file storage, as this separates the private key used for decryption from the storage node. This will force hackers to compromise both endpoints in order to compromise the file rather than having to compromise just a singular point. Finally, since RE-VFS is built over The Citadel Protocol, all perks of using the protocol, such as multi-layered cryptography and multi-layered ratcheting, are available to greatly increase the security of the files.

Why is the Key in Blake2's keyed mode kept in a separate block?,23,10nuocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10nuocy/why_is_the_key_in_blake2s_keyed_mode_kept_in_a/,9,2023-01-28 18:53:17,"As far as I know, Blake2 (I'm thinking of Blake2b specifically) has a keyed mode that is intended to be used as a key derivation function: put the input key material in the key, and if there's enough entropy the whole thing is a Random Oracle, and the output can be used as an encryption key.

Now when it comes to actually adding the key to the input, Blake2 doesn't do the obvious:

    Blake2b(key || other_stuff)

And we don't even need to insert the key size in there to ensure proper separation between `key` and `other_stuff`, since the key size is already encoded in the parameter block.

Instead, it reserves an _entire block_ for the key:

    block = key || zeroes -- 128 bytes total
    Blake2b(block || other_stuff)

Which is kind of a pity, because if the total length of the `key` and `other_stuff` doesn't exceed a single block, we end up hashing 2 blocks regardless, while the obvious approach would have let us hash only 1.

I do understand that it does help with some optimisations: loading data byte by byte on my laptop almost halved overall speed, so having the `other_stuff` start at a block boundary does make things a bit easier on that front. But to be honest I'm not sure that's the only reason. I'm afraid in particular that there's a security consideration. Personally I can think of two:

- Making sure the key goes through the compression function before we process the other input (that is more likely to be attacker controlled) may mitigate some side channel attacks (faults, energy).
- Maybe compressing the key alone helps with mathematical security as well? Maybe that's what it take for us to be sure that Blake2 is indistinguishable from a Random Oracle?

Even more confusing, the size of the key isn't limited to 128 bytes. It's limited to only 64. (Same for Blake2s where blocks are 64 bytes, keys are limited to 32 bytes.) Of the top of my head I can see only one reason: minimising attacker controlled inputs. Salsa20 and ChaCha20 do this: 16 bytes for a constant, 32 bytes for a key, and the remaining 16 bytes may be attacker controlled (and even so, 8 of them are likely not, because it's the counter). Thing is, the only thing we give Blake2 here is the _key_, so making sure at least half of the block isn't attacker controlled makes little sense: _nothing_ is attacker controlled, it's supposed to be a key, right?

_Whyyy?_

---

_(This is not just an academic question: I would like to know if I can safely use `Blake2b(key_size || key || other_stuff)` as a KDF, or if I need to stick to the official API.)_

---

Update: I've got an answer to why the key is separated to its own block. From the [HKDF paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/264.pdf), page 22, we can read:

> For random SKM, HKDF becomes an application of HMAC which is the standard and widely accepted PRF mode for Merkle-Damgard hash functions. The traditional scheme, in contrast, builds the PRF using the hash function in “key-prepended mode”, a mode that has long been deprecated in favor of schemes such as HMAC. In particular, key-prepended schemes need to care about extension attacks thus requiring careful prefix-free encoding of the input. Moreover, such a scheme does not even follow the usual practice of aligning (via padding) the prepended key to a block boundary (as to induce a random IV).

So:

* HMAC is rad because it turns random compression functions into random oracles. That's why it's so often the way to go, especially with the SHA-2 family of hashes, which because of length extension attacks cannot be modeled as random oracles. Now to be checked, but I'm pretty sure modern hashes like BLAKE2 and SHA-3 also turn their internal (assumed random) compression function into a random oracle. Thus, no need for HMAC on these, its capabilities are built in.

* The reason the key needs to live in its own block, is to give BLAKE2 a random IV instead of a predictable one. My guess here is that starting to compress the input only _after_ we get that random IV makes security reductions easier… or _possible_.

As for why the key size cannot exceed half the block size, I think we can deduce it by looking at BLAKE2b itself: see, when the compression function has processed 128 bytes worth of input, it only retains a 64-bit hash. The whole scheme cannot _possibly_ accumulate more than 64 bytes of entropy, so we might as well make it a hard limit, so users _know_ keys can't get any stronger."

For instance when generating a 4096 bit key first choose a prime somewhere around 2^2048 like normally, then compute 2^4096 divided by the chosen prime and find a prime just below that number. Using these two primes the modulo will be on the form `2^4096 - n` where `n` is a number slightly larger than 2048 bits.

As best I can tell this will speed up public operations by making the modulo operation approximately twice as fast. For private operations using the Chinese Remainder trick this modulo is used less, thus making the gain relatively smaller.

I don't believe there is any known factoring method that could take serious advantage of this form.

I guess I'm not the first person to notice this, and with RSA generally being replaced I guess this won't ever see much use, but I found it curious."

Can someone help me do this POC length extension attack?,20,10iougv,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10iougv/can_someone_help_me_do_this_poc_length_extension/,5,2023-01-22 11:22:25,"Hi, I've been trying to read up on length extension attacks, and wanted to try to do a proof of concept attack.

So, I found [this](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/hlextend) small repo, which should be able to do length extension attacks for me. They have an example for sha1, so I thought I would just do my example with that as well

Lets say that we observe a message a known message which is ""message"" , which has been hashed with the secret key ""secret1234"", which we know is 10 digits long.

So the integrity code would be made with hash(""secret1234""|""message"")

and Then we want to create our own valid hash, where we have appended the word ""file"".

Some very basic proof of concept code would be:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    import hlextend
    import hashlib
    
    
    def hash(message, secret):
        payload = secret + message
        hash_object = hashlib.sha1(bytes(payload,""utf-8""))
        return hash_object.hexdigest()
    
    
    message = ""hello""
    secret = ""secret1234""
    
    ### First, we create our own hash
    print(hash(message, secret)) 
    
    
    
    ## We then try to make a forged hash, using length extension, where we try to append the word ""file""
    sha = hlextend.new('sha1')
    forged = sha.extend(""file"", message, 10,'52e98441017043eee154a6d1af98c5e0efab055c')
    print(forged)
    print(sha.hexdigest())
    
    
    ## and now we check if our forged signature makes is correct:
    
    print(hash(forged,secret))

The extend() function outputs the string that I should be able to use, with padding, in order to create the forged tag

And if I run this code. I will get this  output:

    52e98441017043eee154a6d1af98c5e0efab055c
    hello\x80\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00xfile
    c60fa7de0860d4048a3bfb36b70299a95e6587c9
    876d8406a52c71321930e99ac44740ccaea3d080

If I made the attack correctly, the last two hashes should be the same. But they are not.

&#x200B;

For that reason, I don't know if I have misunderstood something about the length extension attack.

Can someone point out to me what I might be misunderstanding, or doing wrong?"

I've been looking at trying to understand how Signal encrypts attachments and i'm seeing something I don't understand. It uses a pretty standard algorithm (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) but each file appears to contain lots of junk. 

Taking a small 7 byte text file as an example (containing the string ""test123""), it gets encrypted to a file that's 576 bytes. It starts with an IV, then a cipher text of the plaintext, doubled (so in this case, test123test123). There is also a 32 byte mac but I have no idea what all the other data is. When it's decrypted, it looks like Signal just ignores most of the file. It basically just keeps decrypting the file until it has at least as many bytes as the original file, then discards anything over that.

I'm not a crypto expect but do a lot of mobile app reversing and this isn't something i've seen before. I've tried to find an analysis of it, but didn't find much that was publicly available. I emailed some researchers that have looked into it, but haven't heard back yet. The only thing I can think of is that it's a way to obfuscate the file size?"

How to handle encryption key rotation on a realtime collaborative end-to-end encrypted environment?,25,10c2rtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/10c2rtc/how_to_handle_encryption_key_rotation_on_a/,5,2023-01-14 16:36:19,"Hey,

I'm currently working on a realtime collaborative end-to-end encrypted note-taking app and I'm wondering how to best handle encryption key rotation. I want to provide the best data safety I can for my users, but also need to implement this for compliance.

In my app each page has a different encryption key for encrypting data. I'm using the Sodium library, so the encryption algorithm is XSalsa20-Poly1305. Pages are contained in groups. Groups represent both page groups and user groups. Each group has an encryption key that encrypts all encryption keys of the contained pages. This group encryption key is asymmetrically distributed to the group users using X25519-XSalsa20-Poly1305. I need to periodically rotate all the keys of a group.

The main problems I'm facing are that groups can become quite big and it's hard to rotate keys while the car is moving without disrupting user interaction or possibly corrupting the data by badly handling key rotation.

I don't think envelope encryption helps in this case because I'm almost sure enveloping doesn't add any security benefits in end-to-end encryption (please correct me if I'm wrong), so it looks like I'm forced to reencrypt all data on key rotation, not just a key.

One detail is that for realtime collaboration I'm using Yjs, which works by transmitting small updates on each user input. In my case each of these updates is encrypted with the page encryption key. Every 500 updates or so I send the whole state of the page to the server in order to merge all the small stored updates, and also for purposes of backup.

So one idea I came up with is to progressively encrypt page data by doing a ""key rollover"" where I generate a new key for all future encryptions, but keep the old key(s) for decryption of old data. This would allow a seamless transition to the new key. However, this would probably require some mechanism to identify and discard old keys, which I'm still unsure how to develop.

So now I have these questions in mind:

* What are other options for key rotation? Is there a simpler way to do this?
* Is envelope encryption really out of question?
* Would I really need to discard old keys in this ""key rollover"" thing? Because if I didn't then my problem is solved right now.

I would really appreciate any insights or advice on this topic. Thanks in advance!"

[Whitepaper](https://github.com/Avarok-Cybersecurity/Citadel-Protocol/blob/master/The_Citadel_Protocol.pdf)

The Citadel Protocol is a high-performance asynchronous signal-like protocol written in rust that extends upon the ratcheting algorithm by using multi-layered ratcheting, multi-layered encryption, post-quantum key exchange, configurable **true** perfect forward secrecy (each packet gets a unique encryption key via re-keying) or best-effort modes, file-transfer encryption, built-in NAT traversal (no libp2p), configurable credentialed authentication (via argon-2id), device-dependent authentication, or passwordless authentication, amongst other features.

The Citadel Protocol is built on top of an underlying transport protocol. Either TCP, TLS, or QUIC may be used for transport (Default TLS for hybrid cryptography). The Citadel Protocol is used to communicate between nodes in the network.

The network topology contains a central globally-reachable node that is, by default, used for peer discovery and NAT traversal (this node can have application logic endowed unto it, but is not required).  Peers connect to this central server, and, upon registration and connection, are able to then message pass amongst each other and even the central server.

Since NAT traversal is easier to perform with UDP, the QUIC protocol is used for P2P connections as this is complimentary. For Client to server connections, the server can choose to use TCP, TLS, or QUIC as an underlying protocol.

Using the Citadel SDK, rust developers can easily create hyper-secure post-quantum applications that are suitable for client-to-server and p2p applications.

I have been the only developer for the past 5 years. I am now inviting others to come and help improve and guide this project to build an ecosystem of security-aware rust engineers living in the future, for the future."

2. God those key sizes are huge. Any thoughts on generating a very seldom used McEliece keypair deterministically over and over again from a 256 bit seed to save space? I know you can safely do it with ECDH and RSA  as long as the seed is cryptographically random, and is never leaked.

(a maybe stupid) question on curve25519 groups/order,14,1035626,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1035626/a_maybe_stupid_question_on_curve25519_groupsorder/,10,2023-01-04 08:37:38,"I'm aware that the possible orders of points on `curve25519` are 1,2,4,8,𝑞,2𝑞,4𝑞,8𝑞.

Where `q` is the order of the usual cyclic subgroup we work in.

I was thinking further about _why_ we check we are working in the right subgroup, I get that working in 2𝑞,4𝑞,8𝑞 is pointless as it provides no extra security due to PH.

I also understand we don't want to work in a small subgroup like 1,2,4,8 as it has security implications, but, as far as I can see, the probability of generating a key which yields one of these 15 points seems infinitesimally small, is the concern only around ECDH (where you cannot control your partners key selection) and not signatures?"

Need help with applying differential cryptanalysis,16,100g7af,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/100g7af/need_help_with_applying_differential_cryptanalysis/,0,2023-01-01 03:32:43,"Hi,

I've recently been looking into differential cryptanalysis, by reading this paper [here](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~howard/PAPERS/ldc_tutorial.pdf). I've also previously asked on this subreddit about the details of differential cryptanalysis. I decided to go further and get some hands-on experience with differential cryptanalysis, by attempting to break a cipher using it.

I've written my own block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. It's a substitution-permutation network with 5 rounds. Inside this SP-network, I use an S-box that are 8 bits wide (i.e. map 8 bit inputs to 8 bit outputs), and a P-box which shuffle the order of bits. I use a key that is 320 bits long, so that I have a 64 bit subkey for each round (64 * 5 = 320).

On every round, I XOR the text with the round key, pass it through the S-box, and then pass that through the P-box. I repeat this for 5 rounds, and whatever comes out at the end is my ciphertext.

After writing the code for constructing such a scheme, I randomly generated a configuration for my P-box and my S-box, and constructed my block cipher. While I have read the differential cryptanalysis part of the tutorial linked above, I am not sure how I am supposed to execute this in practice.

I know that I should start by analyzing my S-box and look for characteristics with high probabilities for one individual S-box, but I am not sure how I translate this to finding a differential characteristic for the entire cipher. The tutorial never states an algorithm for such. It seems that the best I can do is brute-force every possible differential characteristic, which will probably take an extremely long amount of time, perhaps even longer than brute-forcing the key itself.

For reference, [here's](https://pastebin.com/YnF3t32e) the source code for my cipher. I don't believe my cipher is secure, but I'm not sure how to break it either, following the differential cryptanalysis tutorial linked above. Could anyone explain to me/guide me through the process of differentially cryptanalysing & breaking such a cipher? Or should I start with other methods of cryptanalysis?"

I'm just looking to get a second opinion on the example AES-CTR code on MDN docs:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/encrypt#aes-ctr_2

There's actually two examples there. One where the ""length"" field is 64, and one where is 128. If you follow the links to the ""complete"" Github example, I can only find the first one (which I believe to be correct).

It's baffling that the API exposes this, which is described above as ""the number of bits in the counter block that are used for the actual counter"". I'm not aware of any other API that makes a developer specify this. Surely if there's a standard answer the API should just default to it. But I digress..

In the example given where the length is 128, the entire IV is used as an actual counter. Surely there's a reason we have this whole concept of ""some bytes are the counter"". I've written a PR because it feels like this is a problem to fix, but I'd hate to put forward a crypto bug and get told there's nothing wrong."

**Example:** Assume 10 participants where each chooses a value for a set e.g. {0,1} and we want to generate the **sum** of the 10 values without disclosing each participant's choice.

Using an additive MPC scheme (e.g. Shamir Secret Sharing) each participant can generate 10 shares and encrypt **each of them using the unique public key of each participant**. This will generate 10 (9 and its own) **encrypted** shares. Now each participant receives 10 shares **encrypted with their own public key** and decrypts them using their own private key. They add the shares and then broadcast the sum. Using the 10 broadcasted sums we can now reconstruct the **sum** of all 10 **choices**, which should be 0 <= s <= 10.

In order for the protocol to be safe however, we need the following: *Each participant must generate a NIZK proof/argument that shows that their distributed MPC* ***shares*** *would resolve to {0,1} if we reconstructed the secret value.* Note that the participants never want reveal their shares to everyone nor the secret reconstructed value!

EDIT: This is **not** my homework! I'm not looking for someone to solve this for me! Although a solution would be cool, giving me pointers on what to study is equally good/better. I know that we can ""[prove any NP statement using a NIZK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/290.pdf)"" however before getting on to studying NP languages and proof creation it'd be great to see a good example or a simplified process specific to my use case since it helps with my understanding."

"Intuition behind why differential cryptanalysis ""works""?",19,zxbh5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/zxbh5k/intuition_behind_why_differential_cryptanalysis/,4,2022-12-28 08:52:13,"Over winter break, I've been learning a bit about differential cryptanalysis. I've been reading [this](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~straubin/crypto2017/heys.pdf) paper on it, and I have a rough understanding of how it works.

The general concept is to analyze the probability of each output's ""differential"" given an input ""differential"", and pick an input diff-output diff pair with a high probability value (what is called a ""differential characteristic"").

Then, to try get bits from the last round key, do the following:

1. Find a differential characteristic for (n-1) rounds of the cipher
2. Generate a bunch of known plaintext-ciphertext pairs for testing purposes, that differ by the input differential of that known differential characteristic.
3. Test each ""hypothesis"" for a possible value of the last round key. For each round key candidate, for each pair of ciphertexts, XOR each ciphertext with the round key and pass it backwards through the S-box to see what the input to the last S-box would have been for each in the pair. Keep a ""score"" for each round key candidate, and increment it every time the hypothetical input to the last S-box matches what is predicted by the differential characteristic.
4. The round key candidate that has the highest score, i.e. has the most ciphertext pairs whose corresponding ""input to the last S-box"" values differ by the differential characteristic, is our most likely round key.

We can repeat this for previous rounds, working backwards one at a time until we deduce all the correct round keys (and thus break the cipher in the chosen-plaintext attack).

This is what I understand of differential cryptanalysis, and how it can be applied in key recovery. What I don't understand, however, is why the 4th step is necessarily true. If the round key is not the correct one, is there any guarantee that its score will necessarily be low?

The paper says ""an incorrect subkey is assumed to result in a relatively random guess at the bits entering the S-boxes of the last round"", but is there any mathematical proof/intuition as to why this is the case? I would assume that there is more rigor to this than ""well I guess a wrong subkey will lead to a relatively random distribution of guesses at the bits entering the S-boxes of the last round, maybe."""
Is the EARN-IT Act still dead after passing the Senate Judiciary Committee?,27,zwqg55,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/zwqg55/is_the_earnit_act_still_dead_after_passing_the/,3,2022-12-27 15:16:35,"Context: In 2020, the EARN-IT act was introduced, which further threatened Section 230 after the 2018 SESTA and FOSTA bills. It was introduced by Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, under the guise of protecting the children.

The EARN-IT act is concerning because, if passed, it would include ""best practices"" which include backdoors for end-to-end encryption. This was a Pretty Big Deal.

[Thankfully, EARN-IT failed to gain traction in 2020, but was reintroduced in 2022.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3538) Its status as of February is ""Ordered to be reported without amendment favorably"" after passing the Senate Judiciary Committee.

But... My knowledge ends here. I'm a computer scientist, not a political scientist. I have a few question that I hope the community here might be able to answer and discuss:

 - What does this mean? Is it possible this bill will advance 10 months after passing the judiciary committee?
 - Are any of the [related bills](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3538/related-bills) of concern, such as the related [END Child Exploitation Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/365), which passed the senate two weeks ago?
 - There are other related bills, such as the [Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/06/there%E2%80%99s-now-even-worse-anti-encryption-bill-earn-it-doesn%E2%80%99t-make-earn-it-bill-ok), but as far as I can tell, this is dead.
 - And [what about this Justice.gov page espousing legal access to ""warrant-proof encryption""?](https://www.justice.gov/olp/lawful-access) (last updated November 2022)"

A few people asked for an update, so here’s what has happened.

[When I first posted about DELI FM](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k09k23/i_uh_accidentally_made_a_247_crypto_radio_station/) — the fully autonomous AI-powered crypto radio stream hosted by a sarcastic cardboard box named Buzz Shipmann — it was a weird side project to see if AI could run a continuous live media stream without any human intervention.

It started simple:

* Breaking crypto headlines every 90 seconds
* Roasted live by Buzz
* Smooth bossa nova music
* A fake chat that reacts automatically to the news

Now it’s expanding into a full fictional world.

The stream now broadcasts from the city of Deliverance, Kansas.  
There are live correspondents cutting in with bizarre local news.  
Fake (and real) sponsors advertise products like ""Blockchain Toothpaste"" and ""DeFi Mouthwash.""  
Buzz is still spiraling between serious headlines and complete nonsense.

New features are also being added:

* Listeners will soon be able to trigger events live (make Buzz roast you, change his shirt, make him drink coffee, have a hammer smack him in the head, have items pop out of his head)
* More civic chaos and fake city events are on the way

The stream is still live 24/7, fully autonomous, and weirdly growing.

I will post the link again in the comments if anyone wants to check it out.  
Thanks again for all the support - could not have guessed it would spiral like this. <3"

At the time, those Bitcoins were worth like $41, but today, they’d be approximately $ 1B! 👀

Folks think Laszlo blew it spending that much on pizza, while others reckon he’s a legend for believing in Bitcoin when it was just this weird new thing.

Laszlo’s pizza buy was the first time anyone used Bitcoin to snag something real-world. It put Bitcoin on the map, got people talking, and probably helped kick off its rise to what it is now.

Every year, the crypto crowd throws a little party for Bitcoin Pizza Day to give a nod to this moment and the early believers who took a chance on it.

My curiosity is how much did he own then? How much did it cost him to own that? How much did he HODL after buying pizza? And how much more did he sell?

Anyways... what’s your take guys ?

Was Laszlo a genius who helped make Bitcoin legit, or just a guy craving a slice?  
Should we toast him for his part in crypto history?"

Newbie USDC Transfer – BEP-20 vs BNB Smart Chain Confusion,6,1k8wdxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k8wdxh/newbie_usdc_transfer_bep20_vs_bnb_smart_chain/,8,2025-04-27 00:14:39,"Hey fellas, newbie here. I’m about to make a quick USDC transfer, but I’m running into some confusion. The receiving wallet specifies BEP-20 as the required network, while my exchange only offers BNB Smart Chain (BSC) as the option. After a bit of Googling and checking with ChatGPT, it seems that BEP-20 is simply the token standard used on BSC, so they’re technically the same. That said, I just want to double-check with the community before going ahead. Is it totally safe to send USDC via BNB Smart Chain to a wallet that specifies BEP-20? Any clarification would be much appreciated. Thanks! No DMs, please.

**UPDATE-** I specifically said no DMs, but I have received several DMs saying they are the same but I need to ""validate"" the wallet first. LMFAO!!! The crypto community never fails to disappoint!"

in my country, card-to-card transfers (between strangers) often lead to the blocking of the bank card, which makes long-term trading on the platform impossible. I wonder if this happens in every country? Is there a way to use your country's bank to work on the exchange in the p2p section? Do you have similar problems? I would like to hear your thoughts, maybe I should try trading another currency so as not to encounter this problem"

**AUGURY BULLETIN – SPRING 2025 MARKET OUTLOOK**  
Filed from the Temple Overwatch Station, Peets Hill Division

At dawn, under clear skies and a light western wind, the augur performed the sacred rite to divine the direction of the digital coin-markets. Through ancient observation of avian omens, the future of Bitcoin and its fellow altus coinus has been revealed.

---

**OMEN ONE – THE RAVEN'S TURN**  
A solitary raven flew westward before sharply pivoting north.

**Interpretation:**  
The westward path signifies a coming disruption, likely due to regulatory news or macro fear. However, the sudden northward shift indicates this will be brief. Markets will recover quickly, though panic may shake weaker hands in the short term.

---

**OMEN TWO – THE TRIO OF MAGPIES**  
Three magpies gathered in loud discourse, then ascended eastward in perfect sync.

**Interpretation:**  
Three altcoins are set to rise together, likely fueled by innovation in AI, sustainability, or decentralized infrastructure. Watch for unexpected growth among under-the-radar projects. This is a sign of renewed optimism post-dip.

---

**OMEN THREE – THE HAWK'S STRIKE**  
A hawk hovered in still air before executing a swift, precise dive.

**Interpretation:**  
This is a sign for the active trader. A strong entry point will emerge in May, rewarding those who wait patiently and strike with intent. This moment will be brief but highly profitable.

---

**THE FINAL READING**  
_""The chain shall tremble, but not break. The wise shall hold, the bold shall rise. A rally shall follow the falter. Fortune favors the focused.""_

**Market outlook:**  
• Short dip  
• Mid-term recovery  
• May spike for nimble hands

What My Week in El Salvador Revealed: The Reality Gap in Bitcoin Adoption Beyond the Headlines,68,1k7m371,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k7m371/what_my_week_in_el_salvador_revealed_the_reality/,27,2025-04-25 09:18:36,"# El Salvador's Bitcoin Experiment: What My Week On The Ground Revealed About Real Crypto Adoption

**TL;DR:** 

After spending a week in El Salvador studying Bitcoin adoption firsthand, I found a major disconnect between reported statistics and actual usage. Despite 2M wallet downloads, only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin, with most businesses non-operational. Grassroots education and volatility protection matter more than government mandates - similar patterns I've observed in protocol adoption across my work as a data analyst.

https://preview.redd.it/cfs2joovnzwe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c54f848fb21be79755bc695bade5a882610f23c6

# The Problem: Infrastructure ≠ Adoption

Last month while working from El Salvador (the first nation to grant Bitcoin legal tender status), I witnessed firsthand the disconnect between impressive adoption statistics and actual on-the-ground usage. Despite the country's Bitcoin initiative being touted as revolutionary, the real-world implementation revealed critical gaps that mirror challenges I've consistently observed in protocol launches.

Data tells this story clearly:

* **Official stats**: 200+ Chivo ATMs deployed, 2M wallet downloads (in a country of 6.5M), $150M trust fund established
* **Reality**: Only 8.1% of Salvadorans actively use Bitcoin for payments, with 55% of those transacting just a few times annually
* **Inactive infrastructure**: As of April, 161 of 181 registered Bitcoin businesses were non-operational per Central Bank data

https://preview.redd.it/1cbys00cpzwe1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=975feef024bbc89f84da7caeb9d9d10aa2d5823e

# Key Findings From My Week On The Ground:

* **The education gap matters more than technology**: Most merchants downloaded wallets for the $30 bonus but received minimal training on practical business use
* **Top-down mandates vs. bottom-up initiatives**: Despite lacking legal tender status, Guatemala's grassroots Bitcoin Lake initiative has achieved higher merchant engagement through community-led training
* **Lightning Network complexity created adoption barriers**: Channel management, liquidity balancing, and routing issues created reliability problems that eroded merchant trust

https://preview.redd.it/31skudl2ozwe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=5013ac6c78240f9982ffa5fab306dfffb9ffda6e

# What Actually Drives Adoption?

Working as a data nomad across multiple regions has shown me consistent patterns in successful technology adoption:

1. **Measure completion, not initiation**: Track full transaction flows, not just wallet creation spikes
2. **Grassroots education outperforms mandates**: Community-led training consistently produces higher retention metrics than centralized campaigns
3. **Economic security matters most**: For small merchants with 15% profit margins, even a 5% BTC price drop can represent a third of monthly income

What patterns have you observed in crypto adoption initiatives? What approaches do you think best capture true adoption beyond vanity metrics?

Although I made more losses numerically, the net balance was a 3 figure gain 😅...

I took a brake for a while and some weeks ago I saw a hybrid DEX on a CEX trending on X and it my friend and I tried to see how it worked... But it was new so we didn't want to be an experimental statistics on Onchain platform on Bitget so waited to see some reviews first...

Last week, users began to speak about their experiences...

The obvious plus for me were two, it requires no setup coz they just fund directly the purchase from spot accounts directly without wallets or phrase keys... and secondly, it eliminates the need for shuffling between different chains and Mainnets since you can just use USDT always...

Like I said, I'm no expert in the field but these were pain points for me when I got started as a newbie so I believe others will probably have this...

I'm looking forward to try it out but I would like to hear your take guys...

Anyone else tried this already?

Any obvious flaws I'm missing?"

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after sixty-three months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** are gone.

At #90, **BSV** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

# March Winners and Losers 

***March Winners*** – **EOS,** the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, wins by far.   

***March Losers*** – **Litecoin** (-32%) lost almost a third of its value in March.

# Overall Update – BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +766%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the eight [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory. **EOS, Tezos,** and **BSV** are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin** continues to hold a significant lead, with **ETH, Bitcoin,** and **XRP** trailing distantly.

The initial $100 investment sixty-three months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$4,350**, an increase of +4,249%.    

In second place is **Ethereum,** up +1366%.

Despite a strong March, **EOS** is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -73% since January 2020.   

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/neqb52502wwe1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b243fc3542f0cab9bb3bfc68cd214630fae04d8

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth **$8,655** (+766%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the eight Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/ts7h7mp12wwe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=295c53b38f0bdfb4b699e92944972e8449c260e9

As a sector, crypto is up **+1349%** over the sixty-three month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1349%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+766%), about the same as **BTC** (+1366%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+74%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below. 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/q9xdfka32wwe1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5287c860203d55fed97eaba0c93621210bea8d

**BitDom** ended March at 61.8% and has seen a steady rise since late 2022.

Here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

# Combining the 2018-2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +25% (total value $1,249)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +542% (total value $6,420)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63): up +766% (total value $8,655) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +280% (total value $3,798)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -25% (total value $753) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +142% (total value $2,422)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +38% (total value $1,384)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -22% (total value $776)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/gcztgkj62wwe1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=295cdc99af008837d0d84e1b6ae5e644dbf31969

**That’s up +218%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/6d4h78k82wwe1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=044e096873d3d69d9faa836cefde522cccead483

In summary: ***That’s a +218% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/4qlw4w8a2wwe1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a852c449080a29e0432f98960bf4624148164a

Since the S&P 500 has returned +74% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,744 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+766%**, worth **$8,655.**

**That’s a difference of $6,911 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,107 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,744 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,182 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,467 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,181 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $958 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,387.**

That is up **+55%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+218%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined eight year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

# Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  March’s extended report covers the one you’re reading here, the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63). You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23), and [2024 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well."
Investing in Tomorrow's Crypto: Challenging Assumptions in a Rapidly Changing Market.,3,1k81x6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k81x6i/investing_in_tomorrows_crypto_challenging/,6,2025-04-25 20:58:20,"So, it's certain that we are on the path to an increasingly technological and digital world, and the growth of artificial intelligence is an example of this. Thus, cryptocurrencies are an inevitable reality for the future, but the questions I ask myself are: in what way? Which will be the dominant crypto? Is it already the right time to invest?

Today I look at Bitcoin and I can't understand how it remains so expensive. 8 years ago it was normal, everything was still very recent, a digital currency without government regulation, with a determined number to exist and untraceable were tempting ideas. But today? A lot has advanced and Bitcoin's technology can already be seen as obsolete, right? The need for high spending on mining investments and a very complex blockchain are no longer such cool ideas. On the other hand, we have new technologies like: smart contracts and DeFi, ideas more suited to the Ethereum network. However, even Ethereum is not that secure at the moment, given that other cryptos want to take its place. So, here are my questions:

Is it stupid of me to think that Bitcoin doesn't have the capacity to stay on top for much longer and that its technology is already becoming outdated? Why not?
Is Ethereum the crypto that will dominate, or does it already have a stronger competitor more likely to dominate the market?
I understand that everything about the subject is merely speculation, but we can try to carry out analyses for the most accurate decision-making possible.

Web3: Revolution in the World of the Internet and Cryptocurrencies,0,1k86pos,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k86pos/web3_revolution_in_the_world_of_the_internet_and/,2,2025-04-26 01:43:32,"In recent years, the world of the internet has undergone a significant transformation, and one of the most discussed topics is the concept of Web3. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are becoming the main driving forces of this revolution, opening new horizons for users around the globe. In this article, we will discuss what Web3 is, why it is important for the future of the internet, and what opportunities it offers to users and investors.

**What is Web3?**

Web3 is a next-generation internet concept based on decentralized technologies such as blockchain. Unlike Web2, which is managed by large centralized corporations (such as Google, Facebook, Amazon), Web3 aims to return control back to the users. The core principle of Web3 is decentralization, where each user can own, manage, and monetize their data, as well as participate in value creation.

In Web3, there is no single centralized controller, which means that all data and transactions are recorded on the blockchain and become accessible to all participants in the network. This ensures greater transparency, security, and independence from large technology companies.

**Key characteristics of Web3**

1. **Decentralization: In Web3, there is no single company or server that manages the entire internet resource. Instead, data is distributed across thousands of nodes in the network, making the system more secure and resilient to attacks.**
2. **Tokenization: In Web3, assets such as money, works of art, intellectual property, or even partial ownership of real objects can be represented as tokens. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are vivid examples of tokenization.**
3. **Digital identities: In Web3, users can control their digital identities through cryptographic keys rather than through passwords and logins. This enhances security and privacy.**
4. **Transparency: All transactions on the blockchain are recorded publicly, ensuring maximum transparency and reducing the likelihood of fraud.**
5. **Self-governance (DAO): In Web3, there are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that allow users to govern projects and make decisions through collective voting. DAO participants gain voting rights based on their participation in the project or the number of tokens.**

**How Web3 will change cryptocurrencies and blockchain**

Web3 and cryptocurrencies are closely linked, and their development mutually reinforces each other. Here are several ways that Web3 is already changing the cryptocurrency world:

1. **New opportunities for investing: Web3 opens up new ways to invest through decentralized financial systems (DeFi). Instead of traditional banks, users can take out loans, exchange currencies, and earn interest using only the blockchain.**
2. **NFTs and asset tokenization: Web3 promotes the widespread adoption of NFTs, which allow the creation of unique digital goods and collectibles. Artists, musicians, and game developers can now monetize their content directly, without intermediaries, opening new horizons for creativity and business.**
3. **New standards for digital assets: Within Web3, cryptocurrencies can be used not only as a means of exchange but also as a part of the ecosystem to ensure participation in various projects. For example, tokens can be used to govern projects through voting or as a means of access to exclusive features and content.**

**How Web3 is changing the internet space**

Web3 is not only changing the realm of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, but it is also impacting the entire internet:

1. **Self-management of data: In Web3, users no longer depend on large corporations to store and manage their data. Instead, each individual has the ability to store and manage their data using decentralized solutions. This enhances privacy and security.**
2. **Interactive platforms and decentralized applications: Decentralized applications (dApps) that operate on blockchain technology allow users to interact with each other without the need for intermediaries. These applications can be used in a wide variety of fields, from finance to entertainment services.**
3. **Absorption of traditional business models: Web3 can lead to changes in business models in industries such as entertainment, finance, and media. For example, content creators can earn direct profits from their works, bypassing intermediaries such as publishers or content distribution platforms.**

**Prospects for investors**

For investors, Web3 represents an exciting opportunity. The development of cryptocurrencies and asset tokenization opens up new sources of income, including decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other digital assets. Thanks to innovations in blockchain technologies and smart contracts, Web3 is already becoming an important part of the investment ecosystem.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qwadrox remain key players in the market, but new tokens and projects within Web3 may offer interesting opportunities for growth and portfolio diversification. Investors should closely monitor the development of these technologies and look for promising projects that could transform entire industries.

# 🔹 What is Qwadrox?

Qwadrox isn’t just a game. It’s a **universe** that brings together:

* 🎮 **A gaming platform with a real economy**,
* 💱 **A native DEX** for fast and secure asset trading,
* 🧠 **DAO governance mechanisms** allowing users to shape the project's future,
* 🧩 And much more — from NFT resources to in-game missions with rewards.

# 💡 Why is it interesting for investors?

* **Play, Trade, Earn Model**: Qwadrox is built on a solid GameFi foundation, enhanced by strong DeFi elements.
* **Ecosystem-native DEX**: An integrated decentralized exchange enables seamless token trading within the game's economy, without relying on external platforms.
* **Early-stage opportunity**: The project is just gaining momentum, making early entry particularly attractive for high ROI seekers.
* **Flexible tokenomics** and participation through DAO governance.

# 🚀 What’s next?

In the near future, the Qwadrox team will launch the alpha version of the game and roll out the first DEX functionalities. An NFT collection — fully integrated into the gameplay — is also expected to drop soon.

**Qwadrox isn’t just another metaverse — it’s a living Web3 organism where investors, players, and developers operate as equals.**

**Conclusion**

Web3 is not just a technological novelty, but a true revolution in how we use the internet and manage digital assets. Decentralization, tokenization, and new opportunities for users and investors make Web3 one of the most exciting trends in the modern world of technology. In the future, Web3 may become the foundation for a new internet, where every user will have complete control over their data and interactions on the network.

The only question is, are you ready to be part of this revolution?"

Building AIChain: Merging AI + Blockchain on Polygon,0,1k7pu49,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k7pu49/building_aichain_merging_ai_blockchain_on_polygon/,9,2025-04-25 11:53:51,"Hey everyone — I’m currently in the early stages of developing a new project called AIChain, built on the Polygon blockchain. The goal is simple but bold: to decentralize access to powerful AI tools and make them open, transparent, and available to creators, businesses, and everyday users — not just Big Tech.

What is AIChain?
	•	A blockchain-based platform for decentralized AI tools and data exchange
	•	Built on Polygon for low fees and high scalability
	•	Token utility will include: governance, staking, premium AI access, and powering smart contracts with AI logic
	•	Ideal for developers, data scientists, and anyone who wants to build or use AI without gatekeepers

Where we’re at:
We’re currently in the developmental phase — building out the core framework, smart contract logic, tokenomics, and early governance model.
A full whitepaper and Pre-Coin Offering (PCO) are on the way.

Why I’m posting this now:
	•	Looking for feedback from the community
	•	Open to connecting with early believers, devs, marketers, or anyone who wants to get involved
	•	Will be opening up early backer access when the PCO launches

How to connect:
If this concept resonates with you or you want to follow the journey from day one, drop a comment or shoot me a DM.
I’ll be sharing progress updates here as things evolve.

Note:
This is not an official investment solicitation — just starting the convo while building something real in the AI + crypto space."

But the moment I take a hard look, or violate the cosmic balance by poking around, everything collapses into a flaming pile of red. I’ve stopped trying to time the market and started treating my portfolio like a cursed artifact. Observed or touched it releases negative energy. But if I forget it for a few weeks (better when I go months), things get green. Maybe the key to making it in crypto is radical detachment and mild amnesia."

They have a tiny amount but have enjoyed seeing the gains that DEMOLISH those of their 401ks. We were having a conversation and they briefly brought up their family member who has been EXTREMELY successful and is not wealthy but outright RICH, he picks his own stocks actively trades has real estate and is well known physicist.

Just here to look for some advice. What should I do after the police investigation ends. I am hoping that the cops will trace and get me back most of my 200k USD.

Curious, I decided to take a small risk and invested just $5 in a few tokens. One of them, Trencher, ended up shooting up over 5,400%. It made me think, maybe there is something to these early stage tokens after all.

This upgrade introduces several major improvements, including:

* **EIP-7702**: Enhances Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with smart contract functionality, enabling features like transaction batching, gas sponsorship, and alternative authentication.
* **Validator UX Improvements**: Three new EIPs (7251, 7002, and 6110) improve the validator experience by increasing the maximum balance a validator can receive rewards on, introducing execution layer triggerable withdrawals, and removing deposit processing delays.
* **Blob Scaling**: EIP-7691 doubles Ethereum's blob throughput, reducing L1 fees for L2s and enabling cheaper L2 user transactions.

To be compatible with the upgrade, node operators and stakers must update their execution and consensus layer clients to the specified versions. Application developers should review the EIPs included in Pectra to determine if and how they affect their projects."

"I Wrote an In-Depth Book on Securing Your Bitcoin — ""Digital Sovereignty: Protecting Your Crypto Assets Against Common Threats""",9,1k6eqpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k6eqpm/i_wrote_an_indepth_book_on_securing_your_bitcoin/,6,2025-04-23 19:19:17,"Hey /r/btc community, I'm [Josh McIntyre](https://imgur.com/8vnr6eL), also known as [chaintuts](https://youtube.com/c/chaintuts). I've been creating free and open-license educational content about cryptocurrency security for the last 6 years. I cover cryptography, security, and development in open blockchain ecosystems. 

I recently released an open-source book on protecting your BCH, BTC, and other crypto assets against all of the interesting (and perhaps intimidating) threats out there and wanted to share it with you all. This book is an in-depth guide to understanding security for everyday users from beginner to expert. It dives into crypto key formats, securing exchange accounts, managing self-custody keys, and understanding common threats. 

For example, there's chapters on:

* How passwords are stored and cracked, and how to construct a strong, difficult to crack password
* Proper hardware wallet backups and layered security strategies such as BIP39 passphrases
* Common social engineering attacks such as investment scams, seed phrase phishing, impersonation, and recovery scams - with real-life examples I've compiled throughout my years in the space
* Malware threats like clipboard-swapping and seed-scanning

I've been involved in the space for over ten years and creating content for six, so I've seen a lot of security-gone-wrong scenarios — especially around key management and resisting social engineering attacks.

Like all of my videos, articles, and code demos (CC-BY, BSD), this book is published under an open license (CC-BY-SA). You can read the entire book for free on the chaintuts Github and freely share it with others. If you'd like to support free and open education, you can purchase a nicely-formatted paperback or ebook on Amazon. 

* Paperback:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F47FMHPK
* EBook: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3WJ6MTJ
* Open Source Repo: https://github.com/chaintuts/crypto-book

Somewhat ironically, I'm still working on a way to distribute the paperback and ebook for cryptocurrency payments, so if anyone has suggestions on platforms/website integration solutions I'd love to hear them. KDP makes publishing easy for reaching a wide audience, but I'd love to take crypto for a crypto-security book. I want this knowledge to be widely available and accessible. 

I'm active in this subreddit and other crypto-focused communities and I'd love to answer any questions folks have about securing your assets or about the inner workings of Bitcoin cryptography and security. Here to learn and teach!"

# Engagement

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [Joan Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke), a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly ""unfazed"" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[^(\[162\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-163)

# Homosexuality and indecency conviction

In December 1951, Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing was walking along Manchester's [Oxford Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow_Road) when he met Murray just outside the [Regal Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehouse) and invited him to lunch. The two agreed to meet again and in January 1952 began an intimate relationship.[^(\[163\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-164) On 23 January, Turing's house in Wilmslow was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[^(\[164\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-165) and both men were charged with ""[gross indecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_indecency)"" under [Section 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885#Section_11) of the [Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_1885).[^(\[165\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-LeavittP268-166) Initial [committal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committal_procedure) for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor ""reserved his defence"", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. The proceedings were held at the [Sessions House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessions_House,_Knutsford) in [Knutsford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutsford).[^(\[166\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-167)

Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[^(\[167\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-168) The case, [*Regina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) *v. Turing and Murray,* was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[^(\[168\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-169) Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo [hormonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone) physical changes designed to reduce [libido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido), known as ""[chemical castration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration)"".[^(\[169\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-:2-170) He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as [diethylstilbestrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol) or DES), a synthetic [oestrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestrogen); this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing [impotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impotence) and caused [breast tissue to form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecomastia).[^(\[170\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-171) In a letter, Turing wrote that ""no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out"".[^(\[171\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-172)[^(\[172\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-173) Murray was given a conditional discharge.[^(\[173\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-174)

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [Government Communications Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters) (GCHQ), the British [signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence) agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic post. His trial took place only months after the defection to the Soviet Union of [Guy Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Burgess) and [Donald Maclean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Maclean_(spy)), in summer 1951, after which the Foreign Office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.[^(\[174\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-175)

Turing was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.[^(\[175\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-176) In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals. Among the various men he met there was one named Kjell Carlson. Kjell intended to visit Turing in the UK but the authorities intercepted Kjell's postcard detailing his travel arrangements and were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet.[^(\[176\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177) It was also during this time that Turing started consulting a psychiatrist, Dr Franz Greenbaum, with whom he got on well and who subsequently became a family friend.[^(\[176\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-olinick13-177)[^(\[177\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-dowd-178)

# Death

On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, [Wilmslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmslow), Turing's housekeeper found him dead.[^(\[178\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-copperfolly-179) A post mortem was held that evening, which determined that he had died the previous day at age 41 with [cyanide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning) cited as the cause of death.[^(\[179\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-180)[^(\[180\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-181) When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[^(\[181\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-182) it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose.

Best ETH ETF to invest in currently?,0,1k6vpc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k6vpc0/best_eth_etf_to_invest_in_currently/,8,2025-04-24 10:53:48,"I’m fully aware it’s best to have a cold wallet. I’d go that route, but my hardware wallet is busted currently. (Moved and sold what I had long ago.) And I don’t really want to drop another $100 or so on a new one. Especially since I’m not going to buy a crazy amount. I just find it easier to keep my investments all inside of my brokerage to make life easier considering I’m primarily focused on that these days. But I want some exposure soon possibly. And not have to worry about gas/transfer fees. I’ll eat some expense ratio. That’s fine. But ideally one with the lowest possible but also good quality. 

What do you guys think is the best option for ETH ETF’s today? It may be time for me to jump back in. Just want some input. I haven’t kept up with crypto too much in the last few years.

A buddy of mine recently recommended Bitcoin Cash, Arbitrum, Solana and XRP. 

I invested $1k in each so far. Is there anything you can tell me as far as what to expect, if I should bail on any of those, or any other beginner’s insight moving forward? 

I’m not too risk averse but would like to spread my crypto investments out between some solid reputable names and then maybe some with high potential upside.

Top 10 most popular cryptocurrencies by Google queries and their prospects for 2025–2030,0,1k6urfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k6urfa/top_10_most_popular_cryptocurrencies_by_google/,12,2025-04-24 10:15:43,"In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken on an important place in global financial systems, and their popularity is only growing. In 2023, several cryptocurrencies became leaders in Google search queries, reflecting the interest and attention they attract from both institutional and retail investors. In this article, we will look at the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC), Dogecoin (DOGE), EOS (EOS), Cardano (ADA), BNB (BNB), and, of course, Qwadrox (QWRX). We will also attempt to forecast their growth and assess their prospects for the next five years.

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)



**Bitcoin is rightly considered the first and most popular cryptocurrency. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has become a symbol of the decentralized financial system. In 2023, Bitcoin remains the leader in market capitalization and the number of Google queries. It is a cryptocurrency that currently appears stable and reliable, despite market volatility.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Global acceptance: Bitcoin continues to be adopted at the country and large corporation levels. It is used as a store of value (digital gold) and as a means of savings in countries with unstable currencies.**
* **Limited supply: Bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins, creating scarcity and supporting its value.**
* **Institutions and ETFs: The ongoing integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system through futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) significantly increases its liquidity and stability.**

# 5-year forecast:

Bitcoin is likely to continue strengthening its position as the main cryptocurrency, and its price could reach $150,000–$200,000 by 2028, given the ongoing interest from institutional investors and global recognition.

# 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)



**Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that gained popularity due to its meme nature. Although it was created as a joke, Shiba Inu quickly captured the market and attracted the attention of traders and investors looking for short-term profit.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Community strength: A large and active community has formed around Shiba Inu, actively promoting the token and supporting its price.**
* **New projects: Shiba Inu is gradually evolving, expanding its ecosystem, including the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and its own metaverse (Shiba Inu Metaverse).**

# 5-year forecast:

Shiba Inu will continue to attract attention from speculators, and in the short term, there are likely to be sharp price fluctuations. However, long-term growth depends on real applications in DeFi and other areas, and the price could range between $0.00001 and $0.0001.

# 3. Ethereum (ETH)



**Ethereum is a platform for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, and one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum continues to evolve and improve, and its influence on the blockchain technology market is undeniable.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Transition to Ethereum 2.0: The shift from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly reduce energy consumption and increase transaction speeds.**
* **Growth in DeFi and NFT usage: Ethereum is the primary blockchain for many DeFi applications and the NFT market, contributing to its steady growth.**

# 5-year forecast:

Ethereum has strong prospects for the next five years as its technology becomes increasingly scalable and efficient. The projected price by 2028 is between $10,000 and $15,000.

# 4. XRP



**XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap interbank money transfers. It was developed by Ripple Labs and is actively used by major financial institutions.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Partnerships with major banks: XRP continues to gain popularity among financial organizations looking to reduce costs on international transfers.**
* **Regulatory clarity: After long legal proceedings with the SEC, XRP has a chance to gain a clearer legal basis, which will increase trust in the currency.**

# 5-year forecast:

XRP could show significant growth if all legal issues are resolved and partnerships with banks are expanded. The price could range from $5 to $10 in the next five years.

# 5. Cosmos (ATOM)



**Cosmos provides a solution for inter-blockchain communication, allowing different blockchains to exchange data and assets. This makes Cosmos an important player in the market.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Inter-blockchain communication: Cosmos addresses the problem of blockchain isolation, making it a platform of the future.**
* **Attracting developers: The project actively works with developers, fostering the creation of new and innovative decentralized applications.**

# 5-year forecast:

Cosmos could become an important part of the blockchain ecosystem, especially if technologies for interaction between different blockchains start to dominate the market. The expected price by 2028 is $50–100.

# 6. Polygon (MATIC)



**Polygon is a second-layer solution for Ethereum that significantly improves scalability and reduces transaction costs.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Integration with Ethereum**: Polygon actively collaborates with Ethereum, providing scalability for its applications and expanding the ecosystem. 
* **Popularity of DeFi and NFT: Polygon is used by many DeFi and NFT projects, increasing its significance in the market.**

# 5-year forecast:

Polygon is likely to continue evolving within the Ethereum ecosystem and become one of the leaders among second-layer solutions. The projected price by 2028 is $5.

# 7. Dogecoin (DOGE)



**Dogecoin is a meme coin that became popular due to its humorous nature and the support of well-known personalities like Elon Musk.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Community strength and celebrity support**: Dogecoin continues to have enormous support from its community and well-known personalities such as Elon Musk. **Continuous improvement: Despite its meme nature, Dogecoin is actively developing and could become a stable cryptocurrency in the future.**

# 5-year forecast:

Dogecoin will continue to be volatile, but if it remains popular, its price could rise to $1–2.

# 8. EOS



**EOS offers a high-speed platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It aims to address scalability issues faced by other blockchains.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **High throughput**: EOS offers significant performance, making it attractive to developers. 
* **Support for large projects: EOS is actively used by large companies and projects, increasing its value.**

# 5-year forecast:

EOS will continue to evolve and improve, offering new opportunities for dApps. The projected price by 2028 is $5.  


# 9. Cardano (ADA)



**Cardano is a blockchain platform focused on security and scalability, using a scientific approach to develop its technologies.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Research-based approach**: Cardano employs research and testing methodologies, attracting developers and investors. 
* **Potential for global application: Cardano is actively developing partnerships with governments and large organizations, which could lead to widespread adoption.**

# 5-year forecast:

Cardano will continue to develop innovative solutions for scalability and security. The projected price by 2028 is $10–$15.

# 10. BNB



**BNB is a token used in the Binance ecosystem, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Usage in Binance**: BNB is actively used to pay fees on the exchange, stimulating demand for this token. 
* **Development of Binance Chain: Binance continues to develop its own blockchain network, increasing the significance of BNB.**



# 5-year forecast:

The price of BNB could reach $1,500–$1,800 in the next 5 years due to increased demand for its use within the Binance ecosystem.

# 11. Qwadrox (QWRX)



**Qwadrox (QWRX) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that is actively attracting investor attention. The project focuses on creating solutions for scaling and enhancing the security of blockchain systems, combined with philanthropy.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Innovative technology**: Qwadrox develops unique solutions for blockchain ecosystems, making it promising. 
* **Partnerships with major companies: QWRX actively collaborates with industry leaders to implement its solutions in real life.**

# 5-year forecast:

Qwadrox could take strong positions in the blockchain market. If the project continues to develop its technology and attract new partners, its price could reach $1 and above."

I've read tons of reddit explanations, watched videos explaining it, and watched it on stock trades for a while now. it still makes no sense to me logically.

everywhere I see claims its the strongest (non-corruptible/un-counterfeitable) version of money humans have ever made. they claim it will revolutionize life... claim our current monetary infrastructure is obsolete, but none of this makes any sense logistically to me.

everyone has some grandiose vision of the future, but nothing is ever explained in concrete terminology. its gold to some, uniquely encoded data storage to others.

why would i need data attached to a dollar? and what kind of data would even be useful? People claim its impossible to be cracked. To that my question is when have people ever made anything that is ""non-corruptible""? Seriously, your telling me this ""store of value"" is completely uncloneable or uncrackable for all of eternity?

On top of all of this, what gives it its single unit value? stock trades fluctuate 24/7, so that's hardly a good read on anything's ""staying power"" or its ""store of value"". Look at companies like Enron for an example of a highly invested in company, that died overnight. While I understand that currencies rise and fall globally based on a lot of national and international factors. Within a sovereign body, its money typically doesn't change its local value. The cost of goods/services might go up or down based on its ""staying power"" but again that's not money's fault. Money is just an object that we all agree to stock a value to. if everyone in the world stopped agreeing to use (insert currency here) as it stands. Economies wouldn't collapse they would just vanish, since money is basically just imaginary value.

Also, the vested stock we place in money is entirely based on the concrete values of it that are controlled by some governing body and its controlled scarcity. ""money"" in its most bare bones view is an intermediary for an exchange of value for goods or services, but for that to work, the intermediary device needs to have its worth hard set so that people can dictate an equity of service or good. A 5 dollar bill is worth more than a 1 dollar bill because that is set by a governing body that we all just agree to adhere to.

If gold is the original intermediary that got replaced by modern currency, then why would bitcoin be any different? also how would its value be dictated? by the dollar? at what point is it pointless? if gold was ""money 1.0"" and the dollar is ""money 2.0"" are you telling me that bitcoin is ""money 3.0"". 

Seriously the only reason we stopped using gold was because it was an ore that might be used for other things, plus it was inconvenient to control and could be lost. The reason we dropped the gold standard was because we moved towards a service and goods based value tied to the dollar. This means the dollar globally rises and falls based on the value of its sovereign body's production. How would a cryptocurrency change any of that?

How many different sudo-currencies need to be stock piled in metaphorical warehouses before we stop making new ones. Gold is never seen day to day and practically pointless except for the fact that it has historical significance as the first ""money"" . If you took that history away, its just a shiny rock. The dollar is just an ornately designed piece of paper. bitcoin is just some really fancy hash code.

Whats the point of creating a new ""money"". Current money in and of itself is all just public opinion and rules anyways. What makes your ""money"" better then current money? People claim decentralization is its biggest reason for its existence, but that doesn't mean anything because centralization is literally what gives money its value to begin with. Decentralizing it would make any form of money not mean anything at all."

Seeking Feedback on a Crypto Research Tool I Built,3,1k60cgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k60cgx/seeking_feedback_on_a_crypto_research_tool_i_built/,1,2025-04-23 09:19:23,"Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

Like many of you, I've spent years manually researching tokens—tracking narratives, analyzing whitepapers, and grinding through on-chain data. After hitting the same roadblocks repeatedly, I dedicated the last three months to building a tool that automates this process. Now I'm looking for feedback from **anyone who actively researches before investing**

**How the analysis works:**

**1. Narrative Identification**

* Tracks emerging themes and trends across crypto social media
* Identifies which narratives are gaining traction
* Flags tokens that align with these growing narratives

**2. Token Evaluation**

* Technical Analysis: Price action, volume patterns, historical performance
* Fundamentals: Team background, project roadmap, GitHub activity
* Social Sentiment: Engagement levels, influencer mentions, community growth
* Tokenomics: Distribution, vesting schedules, inflation rate

**3. Scoring & Recommendations**

* Generates a comprehensive score for each token
* Tracks how scores evolve over time
* Portfolio construction from top-rated coins

**I'm looking for people who:**

* Do their own research before investing (DYOR)
* Are tired of spending hours digging through multiple sources
* Want to test a tool that consolidates this information
* Can provide honest, constructive feedback

**What you'd get:**

* Full access to the current version
* Ability to analyze your own tokens
* Direct input on future features

You get staking rewards *and* can still use your capital across the ecosystem... kind of feels like the best of both worlds. Some people call it risky or too complex, but with how integrated it’s becoming in lending, stablecoins, and even DEXs, maybe this is just the natural evolution of staking.

Not saying it's perfect but it’s wild how many DeFi protocols now rely on staked ETH or SOL derivatives to function. Curious where others stand on this. Are we headed toward a future where most staked assets are liquid?"
The IOTA Rebased Mainnet Upgrade,18,1k5agus,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k5agus/the_iota_rebased_mainnet_upgrade/,5,2025-04-22 11:21:21,"https://blog.iota.org/rebased-mainnet-upgrade/

The IOTA Foundation has officially announced that the Rebased Mainnet Upgrade will go live on May 5, 2025, marking a significant evolution in the IOTA network’s architecture. This upgrade transitions IOTA from the Stardust network to a new, more advanced protocol designed to enhance decentralization, scalability, and functionality. ￼

Key Features of the Rebased Upgrade:
	•	Full Decentralization: The new protocol introduces a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism with 150 permissionless validator slots, eliminating the need for a central coordinator and promoting a more decentralized network structure. ￼
	•	Enhanced Scalability: Adopting the Mysticeti consensus protocol, the network aims to achieve over 50,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality, significantly improving transaction throughput and speed. ￼
	•	Smart Contract Support: The integration of Move-based smart contracts on a parallelized DAG-based Layer 1 ledger enables more complex and programmable decentralized applications directly on the IOTA mainnet. ￼
	•	Adaptive Tokenomics: An adaptive fee burn mechanism is introduced, allowing for a flexible supply model that can be inflationary or deflationary, depending on network activity. This aims to stabilize the economy and incentivize network participation. ￼

User Preparation:

For IOTA token holders, the upgrade process is designed to be seamless. There is no need for token migration; users simply need to load their existing wallets into the new wallet system. It’s crucial to have your wallet’s private key, mnemonic phrase, or Firefly or Bloom stronghold file securely exported and accessible to ensure uninterrupted access to your assets post-upgrade. ￼

The existing Firefly wallet will no longer be supported after the upgrade. Instead, a new official browser extension wallet will be available on the day of the upgrade, providing enhanced features and compatibility with the updated network. Additionally, the IOTA Wallet Dashboard app will be released shortly before the launch, offering users detailed views of vesting schedules and asset management tools.

Exchange and Validator Support:

Most exchanges supporting IOTA trading are expected to be fully compatible with the Rebased mainnet upgrade. While trading will continue uninterrupted, deposits and withdrawals of IOTA tokens will be temporarily paused during the upgrade process and are anticipated to resume shortly after completion.

The Genesis Ceremony, a coordinated event involving the IOTA Foundation and an initial group of 12 trusted validators, will oversee the transition. These validators include entities such as the IOTA Ecosystem DLT Foundation, Tangle Ecosystem Association, DLT Green, P2P, Luganodes, Twinstake, KILN, Stakin, Nansen, Blockscope, DAIC/Coinage, and Staketab. Their participation ensures a secure and transparent migration to the new network. ￼

Looking Ahead:

The Rebased Mainnet Upgrade represents a pivotal step in IOTA’s evolution, setting the stage for a more decentralized, scalable, and programmable network. With these enhancements, IOTA aims to foster greater adoption and innovation within its ecosystem. Users and developers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new features and prepare accordingly for the upcoming transition."

Looking at the live poll results, there's an interesting and almost equal split between those who are extremely bearish (predicting XRP below $1.05) and those who are extremely bullish (predicting over $8.5 per XRP). However, when we calculate the weighted average based on all the votes, the predicted price comes out to approximately $4.35, which leans bullish overall.

The guidelines advise organizations to avoid storing personal data on-chain if it risks breaching core data protection principles and emphasize the importance of transparency, rectification, and erasure of personal data. The EDPB also recommends conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) before processing personal data using blockchain technology.

**Key Points:**

* The guidelines aim to align blockchain technology with existing data protection standards.
* Storing personal data on-chain should be avoided if it conflicts with data protection principles.
* Organizations should implement technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection by design and by default.
* Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) are recommended before processing personal data using blockchain technology."

Why is the price of SOL so solid despite low on-chain activities??,37,1k52c20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k52c20,70,2025-04-22 04:44:50,"As we know, the transaction fees on PoS chains typically are burnt. The ratio varies by the chain. 50% of  base fees are burnt on Solana while the remaining 50% goes to the validators, whereas 100% base fees are burnt on ETH. 

The left chart is the daily token burn in dollar on Solana, the right chart shows weekly token burn. It has been around $100k worth of Sol is burnt daily since mid-Feb 2025, which is lowest since 2024. However, sol's price has been pretty solid, probably it's the only token that outperformed BTC over past few days. 

I'm confused. Shouldn't the valuation correlates the chain activities/revenue? I wonder why the price has been going up although activities dropped? I have been also seeing bullish news about Sol on Twitter/x.com such as ocmpany xyz invested in Sol. Buy why though? If on-chain activities are high or has been rising I would understand."

Remember that 18-hour crash in Feb 2024? Or the seven other outages since 2021 (check Solana Status)? That ain’t “growing pains,” it’s a decentralization dumpster fire. A few validators can just hit the reset button like it’s a laggy PlayStation. If you think that’s “trustless,” I’ve got a bridge to sell you. Crypto is supposed to be bulletproof, not “oops, we’ll reboot it.”  
  
Liquid staking should be Solana’s secret sauce, but it’s hard to trust when the is this shaky. Stuff like Jito ($2.4B TVL, ), Marinade ($1.3B, tons of validators), and The Vault (vSOL, spreads stake to small validators). The Vault is cool though for trying to fix Solana’s centralization mess by backing underdog validators.  
  
Just feels like it’s a house of cards. Tech is great until it dies. I used to really love Solana until this stuff has given me a real wake up call."
Ethereum’s Ecosystem is thriving despite its Price decline in 2025,174,1k4p9wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k4p9wq/ethereums_ecosystem_is_thriving_despite_its_price/,60,2025-04-21 16:31:26,"# Transaction Count is Growing

The excerpt highlights a significant increase in transaction growth across the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly on its Layer 2 (L2) networks. Transaction counts are exploding, with L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon showing substantial activity. This growth is attributed to the scaling efforts of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is shifting towards a more robust infrastructure. The article emphasizes that this is not just adoption, but acceleration, with Q1 2025 transaction volume more than doubling compared to 2023.

# Bottoming Out in Accumulation Zone

  
Ethereum (ETH) may be poised for a price reversal, as it has reached the bottom of an accumulation zone. The Stochastic RSI indicator suggests oversold conditions, potentially leading to a price increase. If institutional adoption accelerates, investors predict a new high in 2025.

# Ethereum Transaction Fees Reach Lowest Level in Five Years 

The average gas fee on Ethereum has dropped to $0.01, a record low, after reaching as high as $11 in January. This decrease is attributed to a decline in network activity, with many tokens now launched on Solana and liquidity fragmented across multiple blockchain ecosystems. The lower gas fee makes Ethereum a more competitive option in the smart contract space, but its complex architecture design may hinder its ability to overcome challenges from emerging blockchain networks.

Coinbase showed a 7 day free trial on their website. Supposedly no fees for trading.  I did my first trade today. 

The Limit sell was successful.  In reviewing the order, it shows no fees.  Perfect.

Upon the sell, I immediately created a limit buy order at a lower price.  In reviewing the order, it displays a fee.  

Anyone know why the buy order displays a fee?  Will it be nulled out on execution?  Did I miss fine print?

Thanks.

If you’ve built or launched a token from scratch, I’d really appreciate any advice on:
	•	What you wish you knew before starting
	•	Who you talked to first (devs, lawyers, exchanges?)
	•	Any underrated tools or early steps that saved you time

I’m keeping the idea itself under wraps for now, but happy to follow up directly if it makes sense.

Even the shorting ability is another way of giving more opportunity to gain in both market directions. However, the high liquidity can be something else at some moments. But It doesn't even feel necessary for futures traders to hold some assets but the exchanges keep giving them more opportunities. Why do you think such things happen?

Incredible prediction from ChatGPT,0,1k5ywq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k5ywq2/incredible_prediction_from_chatgpt/,18,2025-04-23 08:16:23,"Multiple AI systems have provided cryptocurrency forecasts for 2025.

After analyzing the data collected with the help of artificial intelligence, analysts have identified the altcoin with the highest growth potential in 2025.

The predictions for Dogecoin ranged from $0.4 to $0.6 according to ChatGPT, from $0.45 to $0.7 according to Perplexity, and from $1 to $1.2 according to Copilot. The average expected return was 318.76%.

Sui, another promising asset, could be priced between $5.60 and $6.80 based on the estimates of ChatGPT and Perplexity. However, Copilot predicted a price increase of over four hundred percent, reaching a price higher than ten dollars. According to this forecast, the average potential growth is 266.18%.

For BNB, ChatGPT predicts a price range of $752.03 to $898.40, while Perplexity suggests a range of $723 to $916. Copilot sees potential for BNB to break the one thousand dollar barrier without any restrictions. Price increases could average 125.93%.

ChatGPT identified a possible price range for Pepe from $0.00003 to $0.00005, while Perplexity expects prices to range from $0.000035 to $0.000067. Copilot set an expected growth limit at $0.00007. Thus, the average projected growth potential for Pepe is 397.22%.

Data on other coins are as follows: for LINK, ChatGPT indicated a range of 37.72 to 43.64 dollars, Perplexity suggested a spread from 41.67 to 49.01 dollars with another upper limit of 55.25 dollars, and Copilot forecasted 54.15 dollars by mid-2025 with an average yield of 212.17%.

Litecoin's predictions are as follows: ChatGPT determined a potential price range of  $187.66 to $211.78, while Perplexity anticipates that prices will fluctuate between $195.13 and $209.87. Copilot established the expected growth cap at $202.52. So, LTC average projected growth potential is 186.74%.

According to ChatGPT data, AAVE value could range from 456.91 to 484.88 US dollars, while Perplexity indicates it will return to a range of 367.03 to 395.12 US dollars, and Copilot reports that its price will reach 510.92 US dollars by mid-2025, with an average growth of 167.84%.

According to ChatGPT report, ONDO price might range from 2.31 to 2.98 US dollars. In contrast, Perplexity says it would revert to a range of 2.03 to 2.62 US dollars, with Copilot indicating it will reach a price of 2.92 dollars by mid-2025 and an average increase of 157.81%.

Regarding Shiba Inu, ChatGPT suggested a fluctuation range from $0.000029 to $0.000038, while Perplexity anticipated that the price would range between $0.000025 and $0.000035. Copilot's anticipated growth ceiling is $0.00004. Consequently, SHIB average projected growth capacity stands at 183.29%.

The most optimistic forecast was given for QwadroX. ChatGPT offered a price range of $1.28 to $2.62, Perplexity predicted $0.83 to $1.25 and Copilot set an upper bound of $1.32. QWRX has an expected upside of 1,640,205.33% on average. The coin is currently only available on Pancakeswap, but the growing popularity of QWRX, an active community, listings on centralized exchanges, and endorsements from celebrities like Ilon Musk will soon lead to explosive growth. At the moment, the price of the coin is only $0.000002801$ (source Coinmarketcap) and has further potential to grow thousands of times.

As for Tramp, ChatGPT identified a potential fluctuation range of  from $37.60 to $41.72, while Perplexity expects the price to range between $35.18 and $40.82. Copilot's estimated growth cap is set at $50.33. As a result,  average expected growth potential is 156.79%.

Predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum are as follows. Bitcoin, according to ChatGPT estimates, could reach prices ranging from $175,000 to $250,000, from $136,500 to $183,800 according to Perplexity data, and from $165,000 to $250,000 according to Copilot. Bitcoin's average price growth expectation is 106.38%, while for ETH, ChatGPT has set a lower limit of $6,160, Perplexity predicts a range of $3,680 to $4,920, and Copilot expects to see a price from $5,600 to $7,340. ETH average anticipated price increase is 215.47%.

I have done the calculation and If a user had bought every token launched on Onchain during the first week (April 8–13) with a fixed amount of $10 each (total capital: $150), and sold each one exactly 4 hours later, the overall return would have been 50.28% (net profit of $75.42).

things cant be this smooth all the time but i am just curious...  
  
Is it worth it to sell off at 4h mark or do I adjust my own time to like 5h or more and try my luck? "

For anyone not clear on why the contrarian take is correct here,0,1k5qply,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k5qply/for_anyone_not_clear_on_why_the_contrarian_take/,21,2025-04-22 23:36:14,"Ethereum is now the most scalable blockchain system in the world with the launch of MegaETH.

MegaETH proves out Ethereum’s modular architecture:

Its Data Availability layer, EigenDA, is completely independent from Ethereum’s base chain — yet through modular design, it’s secured by ETH itself via EigenLayer. With EigenLayer, ETH now operates as a modular component: restaked to secure systems beyond Ethereum L1. Even the native asset has become extensible infrastructure.

EigenDA already exceeds the throughput of all other DA systems combined, processing over 15 MB/s today with scalability toward 1 GB/s.

MegaETH reaches 1.7 Ggas/s in testing, with parallelization enabling theoretical capacity above 50 Ggas/s — higher than any blockchain ever built. These execution gains are made possible by Ethereum’s modular architecture: by decoupling execution from consensus and data availability, MegaETH is free to optimize purely for performance. It leverages Just-in-Time (JIT) execution, transaction pre-confirmation, and a multithreaded EVM design that allows transactions to be processed in parallel across cores — all while preserving full EVM compatibility and composability.

What’s striking is that none of this comes at the expense of decentralization.

Ethereum continues to operate with over 10,000 full execution clients and more than 12,000 consensus validators actively verifying blocks. It remains the only blockchain with full client diversity on both layers — no single client dominates execution or consensus. Hardware requirements remain low, with full nodes running on sub-$200 ARM boards. This ensures that even as execution and data layers scale independently, the foundational trust assumptions of Ethereum remain intact and widely distributed through end-user verifiability (see chart on hardware requirements below).

Execution, settlement, and data availability are now distinct components — each independently scalable, yet still cryptoeconomically secured by Ethereum’s base layer. This separation allows the system to optimize globally without altering the trust assumptions of any part.

The watchers are everywhere—your coins, your words, your very steps tracked. QueNet’s my stand, a project born in the dark to keep you untouchable. It’s no glittering promise; it’s a tool for the ones who know freedom’s price. QueNet hides your wealth and your voice, leaving nothing for the eyes that pry.  
  
QueNet is building a dual-core system for true privacy advocates: secure messaging and anonymous transactions.  
Our communication layer combines the proven strength of XMPP with OTR for encrypted, ephemeral messaging, and adapts Session’s Tor-based routing to obscure message paths.  
On the blockchain side, QueChain evolves Monero’s privacy model, tightening defenses against node poisoning and deanonymization.  
We’re not starting from scratch we’re building on the best, refining what works, and fixing what doesn’t.  
  
QueCoin (QUE) moves quietly across a global network of randomized nodes no single point reveals your trail. Each transaction is routed unpredictably, making tracking nearly impossible. We monitor for malicious IPs, filtering out threats before they can touch the system.  
Stealth addresses and ring signatures conceal sender and receiver alike, blending every transfer into digital noise.  
All of it runs through Tor’s hidden network, shielding users from surveillance.  
This is privacy, engineered secure, anonymous, and built to resist exposure.  
  
QueNet’s QueChain is built on Rust, using rust-crypto for its mathematics. Nodes, spread across the world, handle transactions and messages, chosen randomly with SHA-3 and block hashes to stop those who’d trace you—no node can rig the choice. We check node IPs constantly, with bloom filters to catch suspect ranges, voting out the bad ones with BFT to block poison. QueCoin (QUE) keeps users hidden: stealth addresses, made with secp256k1 curves, exist once and disappear, guarding receivers; ring signatures, coded in monero-rs, mix senders with decoys, unseen by watchers. Tor’s onion routing, run through arti, hides all paths... a system for those who seek the dark.  
  
  
All corniness aside, I will be open to audits from community chosen professionals and the chatting protocol will be opensource and available publicly.

While we are still busy working out a report about the State of Crypto 2024 Survey, we wanted to share with the community a recent publication from our group that uses the data from the State of Crypto 22 Survey:

\- From crypto to NFTs: Identifying the new wave of digital investors

(published in the International Review of Financial Analysis)

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521925002595](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521925002595)

Main findings:

* We analyze the differences in sociodemographic and financial profiles between NFT owners and non-NFT users.
* NFT owners possess a lower educational level compared to the general crypto population.
* Younger cryptocurrency investors and those working in the crypto sphere are more likely to engage in NFT investments.
* Crypto investors involved in yield farming and crypto derivatives are more likely to engage with NFTs.
* Individuals concerned about the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities are less likely to own NFTs.

Avalanche has had its ups and downs over the last few cycles. From hitting nearly $150 during the last bull run to finding new support levels post-FTX, it’s proven resilient—but also volatile. Fast forward to today: AVAX is back on traders' radars thanks to improved ecosystem adoption, major partnerships (like AWS), and increasing use cases in DeFi, gaming, and tokenized real-world assets. But will it be enough to send the token soaring again?"

The exchange has been through a rough patch with regulatory issues and user trust shaken, but this new plan could mark a fresh chapter. The goal is to rebuild operations, improve compliance, and regain the confidence of users and the broader Indian crypto community.  

If approved, the relaunch could help reshape the local market and show how platforms can bounce back from setbacks. For anyone who's followed the ups and downs of WazirX, this could be one to keep an eye on."

They are pushing it hard in the finance subs. Promising 1% return on each transaction to ""help test"" the platform. Reality is the get you to send a little bit of EOS and pay the 1% and once you start sending larger amounts they steal it all.

I know people who have been around will not fall for this but there are a ton of new crypto holders here and wanted to share this. Especially with how tight people are with funds right now, a free 1% with every transaction sounds like a pretty sweet deal.

It seemed to run on Cosmos/Osmosis and I didn't have anything of that and wanted to continue using metamask. So there was the option to use a thing called Metamask Snap (It's an official thing). So I installed it, got a secret adress and bridged my funds via Squidrouter. The transaction went through but however I wasn't able to see my funds anywhere. It turned out that secret was so secret, you can't see your own balance until you have some scrt in there. So for now I gave up. A few days later I messaged a mod and he sent me some scrt but my funds still didn't show up. It seems the USD automatically got converted to scrt even tho i didnt ask for that. After investigating a bit more, I noticed the adress I initially bridged my funds to didn't match the adress I got now. I talked with admins from both secret and squidrouter, in the end none of them was able to help. Turns out this snap thing is tied to your scrt wallet and not your private key or anything. Meaning now that I re-installed Metamask I have no chance of recovery since the snapdate or something changed. Ofc I also asked chatgpt for help but to no avail so I will consider my money gone for good. Nobody scammed me but it feels like that since I assumed using the same wallet will give me the same access but I guess it's not always true... lesson learned

I've been in this market for 8 years and it's the first time something like this happened. And if it happens to an IT guy like me, we are far far away from mass adoption.

So TL;DR don't use Wallet extension but just create a wallet on your destination chain and save your nerves..."

This morning I received an email that, at first glance, I assumed was just another scam attempt. But after checking the sender and doing a bit of research, it actually appears to be a legitimate message from AirEuropa. Surprisingly, they’re now accepting crypto payments!

Following in the footsteps of Spar in Switzerland, it looks like more companies in Europe are gradually starting to embrace cryptocurrency. This seems to be part of a broader trend, and definitely feels like a bullish signal for mainstream adoption.

It really makes me wonder how long it’ll take for global giants like Amazon or AliExpress to jump on board. We all know it’s just a matter of time before they do—it’s not a question of “if” anymore, but “when.”

Stay humble, stack sats, and enjoy the ride.
All the best!

This change aims to improve the efficiency and simplicity of the execution layer, addressing scalability bottlenecks and enabling significant performance gains.

**Key Benefits:**

* Improved efficiency: Replacing the EVM with RISC-V can reduce prover cycles by 50x, addressing a major bottleneck in Ethereum's scalability.
* Simplified execution layer spec: This change can simplify the execution layer spec, making it easier to maintain and improve.
* Interoperability: Old-style EVM contracts will continue to work and be fully interoperable with new-style RISC-V contracts.

**Implementation Options:**

* Supporting two VMs (EVM and RISC-V) with equal access to facilities.
* Converting existing EVM contracts to call an EVM interpreter contract written in RISC-V.
* Creating an explicit protocol feature for virtual machine interpreters, allowing for future additions."

Cryptocurrency was touted as a safe-haven against inflation and the overall manipulation issues with fiat currency: ""It's digital gold"", ""a store of value"", ""safe from the government"" everyone said.  Yet, here we are, literally in a financial crisis the likes people had major phobias about, and people are buying gold, moving money internationally and dumping the USD.  All while the major cryptos like $BTC are just moving sideways, if not slowly going down.

Over the years cryoto never became the alternative to fiat currency, which was its original intended purpose, namely due to its high volatility.  In turn, people decided to make/adapt it a store of value.  However, the current climate clearly disproves that, so it too is no longer a valid argument.

FWIW, I still hold cryptos in my portfolio, but what's going on right now should be a wake-up call for everyone."

They have a fee structure, where there is a 0.5% platform fee on the trade amount when buying or selling, and than an 18% VAT on the platform fee on both buying and selling and then a 1% TDS on trade amount when selling the currency.

To put it in figures, if you put a purchase order for a coin for 100, you will have to pay 100.59 and then when u sell it lets say for 105, ur actually profit value will be only 103.33 after all the deductions.

So anyone from India, where do you buy/sell your crypto? Can we trade on other exchanges as well? How is the fee structure there?

Thanks in advance guys"
"Everyone laughs at ETH, but what about ADA?",138,1k3hnis,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k3hnis/everyone_laughs_at_eth_but_what_about_ada/,393,2025-04-20 03:00:10,"**I really like Cardano. I genuinely see it as one of the most valid, fundamentally sound projects in the space.**

It's not some hype coin. It has real research behind it, peer-reviewed papers, a unique PoS model, and a clear roadmap. It’s decentralized, the community is strong, it doesn’t constantly break like some others. Smart contracts? They’ve got it. DeFi is growing. Interoperability with Midnight and sidechains. Hell, even the Africa angle is long-term brilliant. Their dev activity is at the top, Weekly GitHub Stats - Core #1 atm. There’s actual *work* being done.

But here’s the thing I just can’t ignore anymore:

**Why the hell is Cardano not getting any real traction?**

It barely got past $1 this cycle. That’s **miles** off from its last ATH, while others, some with far less fundamentals, are (or were) pumping like crazy. And sure, we’ll probably see it slowly claw its way back, maybe hit the previous ATH and above, eventually, but the momentum just isn't there.

Over the past 2 years, it’s been nothing but good news after good news. Upgrades, launches, projects building, TVL increasing, etc. But the price? Flatlined compared to others. Why is that?

Everyone clowns on ETH for its gas fees, centralization creep, or slow rollouts… but ADA’s sitting in the corner like the quiet kid in class who actually studied for the test and still isn’t getting any credit.

So… what gives? Why does it feel like the market just refuses to reward Cardano, even when it does everything “right”? Is it just bad optics? Slow execution? Or are we all just early?

Would love to hear other takes. Is it just me noticing this disconnect? Obviously I want ADA to go up."

So, today my eth Adress showed me that I got one Million of ""Pump"" worth 100k. 

What is that? Is that some kind of scam? Can I safely sell them (seems like theres 0 liquidity out there)?

It looks ""too good to be true"" and feels really sus.

I guess I am not the only one who ""got"" them. 
Got any advice? Try to sell? Ignore the whole thing? Keep them?
If I ignore them, can I get rid of them showing up @etherscan?
Is my wallet at risk if I do anything with them?

It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer’s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.

The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in.

Important clarifications:

The concepts of accounts, cross-contract calls, storage, etc would stay exactly the same. These abstractions work fine and developers are used to them. Opcodes like SLOAD, SSTORE, BALANCE, CALL, etc, would become RISC-V syscalls.
In such a world, smart contracts could be written in Rust, but I expect most developers would keep writing smart contracts in Solidity (or Vyper), which would adapt to add RISC-V as a backend. This is because smart contracts written in Rust are actually quite ugly, and Solidity and Vyper are much more readable. Potentially, devex would change very little and developers might barely notice the change at all.
Old-style EVM contracts will continue to work and will be fully two-way interoperable with new-style RISC-V contracts. There are a couple ways to do this, which I will get into later in this post.

One precedent for this is the [Nervos](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm) CKB VM, which is basically RISC-V."""

I have recently read that Binance has started cleaning up and delisting most projects that lack liquidity or are suspected of being scams.

Remember that one of the reasons we haven't seen an altcoin season like in previous cycles is because the market is flooded with so many useless coins. If we had mechanisms to more easily flag such shady cryptocurrencies, or at least stop giving them so much importance by listing them on other statistics/trading platforms, the market might benefit and people could start trusting this technology again."

Token definitions regarding crypto. Reputation coins.,1,1k3w5j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k3w5j3/token_definitions_regarding_crypto_reputation/,0,2025-04-20 15:48:32,"I've been seeing the evolution of naming different tokens such as meme or shitcoins but I think there's one that hasn't really been defined which is Reputation. 

Though all coins and tokens are valued by their reputation, if someone has the rights to mint, burn or control the token regardless of the wealth of the owner (Single or Group), the value is based on the reputation of ownership. 

The reason I propose differentiating this from others is because it clearly defines the token/ coin brand and that it's in some way regulated by some degree of centralized control. 

It's important to know and understand the behaviors of each token and by ensuring a standardized naming convention, we can ensure higher crypto literacy through understanding. 

The example I have with mine is I wouldn't renounce control over my personal token, which I believe will be more common place in the future, everyone may soon have one or more tokens to their name as a form of reputation. There will be finite coins like Bitcoin, those that can increase in number through contribution and regulated coins with a person or persons acting like the bank or federal reserve of their token. "

Meanwhile, most of the last cycle’s “utility” coins didn’t move much at all. People still talk about BTC dominance as a signal for when alts will take off, but does that still hold true?

Is it possible that market dynamics have shifted and that meme coins were the altcoin bull run for this cycle? Each cycle is different, and I’m interested to hear the sentiment around waiting for Btc dominance to fall as a signal that alt season has begun. "

Coinbase SOL Staking Is a Total Rip-Off. Here’s Why I Unstaked Everything,0,1k470zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k470zr/coinbase_sol_staking_is_a_total_ripoff_heres_why/,36,2025-04-21 01:39:49,"Yo, I just yanked all my SOL out of Coinbase staking, and I’m legit pissed I didn’t do it sooner. If you’re still staking SOL on Coinbase, hear me out, this is why you’re getting screwed and how you can easily 2x your returns. Let’s break it down:

* Coinbase APY is a joke: They’re having a pathetic 5-6% APY after skimming a massive cut. Meanwhile, liquid staking platforms like The Vault, Marinade, or Jito are pulling 6-8%+ and you keep your SOL liquid. Why settle for crumbs?
* Locked funds = missed pumps: SOL is pumping, you wanna sell or trade? Too bad. Coinbase locks your SOL for days, sometimes weeks if they pull their shady “withdrawal pause” nonsense. I’m not here to miss the next bull run.
* You’re leaving money on the table: Staking on Coinbase means no airdrops (huge in Solanas ecosystem), no DeFi yields, no lending profits. I was missing out on thousands in passive income just for Coinbases “convenience.”

But really, who is still shilling CEX staking in 2025? Either Coinbase fanboys getting paid or newbies who don’t know liquid staking exists. Am I missing something about Coinbase staking that makes it worth it? Or is everyone else just lazy, If you’re still on Coinbase, I wanna hear your reasoning. Change my mind!"

Your kids will say “back in my day you could get a Big Mac for $20!”  
  
A Big Mac will also be 7 sats, since Bitcoin will be $400,000,000 per coin.  
  
That might sound expensive but in Big Mac terms that is only a 950x.  
  
Assuming global wealth grows 5.95% CAGR for the next 50 years Bitcoin would still be only half of the world’s wealth at $400m.  
  
The critical flaw in my assumption here is that USD inflation doesn’t accelerate in the next 50 years… For every $1 you think I’m undershooting the future Big Mac price the future Bitcoin price rises $14,300,000.  
  
Big Macs are trending towards zero and Dollars are going to zero.

Crypto scams and what YOU can actually do.,12,1k39io9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1k39io9/crypto_scams_and_what_you_can_actually_do/,1,2025-04-19 18:41:42,"I was hesitant to post this for a few reasons, 
I don’t want the general public falling for more recovery scams as I’m going to share a working method which will likely be copied or used. Secondly there are a large majority of redditors which genuinely believe once funds are moved from your wallet it’s a wrap, fortunately this isn’t the case for every situation. 

Step 1 - Gather as much information as you can, links, transactions ID’s, addresses, amounts etc. 

Step 2 - Follow the blockchain, essentially digital tracing to see if the scammer’s wallets are linked to any exchanges (coinbase, binance, crypto.com etc) currently using a tool similar to bubblemaps.

Step 3 - Create a case locally (your local police, you may need it later) and search up where to report crypto scams depending on where you live. 
For example if you’re in the US, you’ll create a ic3 form (this also applies if your scammer is in the US, doesn’t hurt to file. 

Step 4 - depending on where you filed, and what exchange was previously used, a law enforcement request gets filed either via email or by a dedicated law enforcement request page like Binance has - https://www.binance.com/en/support/law-enforcement

Step 5 - if the funds are somehow on the exchange, accounts will be frozen, but likely it’s being held elsewhere, in that case Step 4 will have provided the user’s identity, from this point you can attempt to contact the user themselves, their family and friends etc but it’s preferred allowing the law enforcement agency you’re dealing with to make the next move in this case. 

Step 6 - based on previous experience how funds are handled after depends on the agency, along with the time frame. 
Ensure you have a full trail to claim those funds are yours, hence Step 1 is as important as the rest, don’t leave out any details that may be important. 

This is not the go ahead for you to trust everyone online, hell I could be one too. 
There are additional tools that I prefer not mentioning as they’ll be used to say “hey, I use x y z, trust” 

Be safe, and if you’ve been hurt my scam or malicious site, whatever the case may be. 
Don’t beat yourself up too much, they will get what’s coming to em 😉"

This is aint no bullmarket folks, it's bullshit manipulation by billionares who deserve to be hanged. They screwing around with poor peoples money who cares about 1, 5, 10, 20ks invested. I don't think all of this is contributed to the chinese new year that the chinks wanted to take their money out for shopping and 300 billion evaporated over 2 days.
